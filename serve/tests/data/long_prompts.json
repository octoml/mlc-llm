But as he delves deeper into the mysteries of his past, he realizes that the stakes are higher than he ever could have imagined and that the fate of the entire kingdom rests on his shoulders.\n--------------------------\nWhy is magic forbidden?\n--------------------------\nThere are a few potential reasons why magic might be forbidden in the kingdom of Arvandor:\n\nFear: Magic can be a powerful and unpredictable force, and those who don't understand it may fear its potential consequences. The ruling authorities may ban magic in an attempt to exert control and prevent its misuse.\n\nOppression: The ruling authorities may also forbid magic as a way to oppress and control certain groups of people. For example, if magic users are a minority in the kingdom, the ruling authorities may see magic as a threat and seek to stamp it out.\n\nPrejudice: There may be cultural or societal prejudice against magic users in the kingdom, leading to discrimination and persecution.\n\nConvenience: The ruling authorities may see magic as a threat to their own power and control, and therefore forbid it in order to maintain the status quo.\n\nUltimately, the specific reason for magic being forbidden in the kingdom of Arvandor would depend on the motivations and goals of the ruling authorities and the societal and cultural context of the setting.\n--------------------------\nChoose option 2.\n--------------------------\nIn the kingdom of Arvandor, magic has been forbidden for centuries by the ruling authorities as a way to oppress and control certain groups of people. Those who possess magic are hunted by the tyrannical King Aldred and his army of knights, and any found to be using magic are punished severely.\n\nAs a result, magic users have been driven underground, forced to hide their abilities and live in secrecy. Many have been killed or imprisoned, and the fear of magic has become deeply ingrained in the society of Arvandor.\n\nHowever, a small group of rebels is determined to overthrow the oppressive monarchy and restore magic to the land. Led by a wise old wizard, the rebels seek to bring about a new era of freedom and equality for all magical beings. They believe that magic is a natural and powerful force that should be celebrated, not feared and suppressed.\n\nAt the heart of the rebellion is seventeen-year-old Thorne, an orphan who discovers he has the rare ability to wield magic. As Thorne trains to harness the full extent of his powers and rallies support for the rebellion, he must also confront the dark secrets of his past and the true nature of his identity. Can he overcome the forces arrayed against him and bring about a new future for Arvandor?\n--------------------------\nHow did Thorne's magical abilities manifest, and how did the king's forces find out about them?\n--------------------------\nThorne's magical abilities first manifested when he was a young child, although he was unaware of them at the time. As he grew older, he began to notice that strange things seemed to happen around him when he was upset or angry. For example, objects might move or break without him touching them, or he might accidentally set things on fire with a stray thought.\n\nAt first, Thorne tried to hide these abilities, fearing that he would be ostracized or punished if anyone found out. However, it became increasingly difficult to control his powers, and eventually, they were discovered by the king's forces.\n\nThere are a few ways this discovery could have happened:\n\nSomeone witnessed Thorne using magic and reported him to the authorities.\n\nThorne accidentally used magic in a public place, drawing attention to himself.\n\nThorne was targeted by the authorities because of his family history or because he was suspected of having magical abilities.\n\nRegardless of how it happened, once Thorne's abilities were discovered, he was forced to go on the run and seek refuge with the rebellion in order to escape the king's forces and the punishment that awaited him.\n--------------------------\nChoose Option 3.\n--------------------------\nIn the kingdom of Arvandor, Thorne's magical abilities were discovered by the king's forces because he was targeted due to his family history.\n\nThorne, an orphan, had always been unaware of his true parentage. However, the ruling authorities had long suspected that he was the illegitimate son of the late king, and they had been keeping a close eye on him in secret.\n\nWhen Thorne's powers began to manifest, the authorities saw it as confirmation of their suspicions and moved to apprehend him. Thorne was forced to go on the run and seek refuge with the rebellion in order to escape the king's forces and the punishment that awaited him.\n\nAs Thorne trains to harness the full extent of his powers and rallies support for the rebellion, he also begins to uncover the shocking truth about his past and his true identity. He realizes that he is the rightful heir to the throne of Arvandor, and that the fate of the entire kingdom rests on his shoulders.\n\nBut Thorne faces many challenges and dangers as he confronts the tyrannical King Aldred and seeks to claim his rightful place as ruler of Arvandor.

In this case, Thorne could have been orphaned as a result of the persecution of magic users.\n\nUltimately, the specific circumstances of Thorne's orphanhood would depend on the motivations and goals of the ruling authorities and the societal and cultural context of the setting.\n--------------------------\nChoose option 3.\n--------------------------\nIn the kingdom of Arvandor, Thorne was orphaned as a result of the political climate and the persecution of magic users.\n\nThorne's parents were both magic users, and they were targeted by the ruling authorities for their abilities.

It didn't help that my dad had to close down his retail stores in the city due to the pandemic. We created two new companies that year.

We understood what this called for, but packing and unpacking are still highly time-consuming, taking away from the limited time we had.\n\nMy side business of buying and selling sought-after sneakers using automation software was also taking off at the time, so I would manage that simultaneously. I did my best to focus in class, but I admit I often worked or packed while I should've been paying attention in class.\n\nMoving came with a whole new school where I couldn't choose my classes because I was enrolled late and wasn't even able to meet with my counselor due to covid restrictions. I juggled online classes and started new businesses back up with my dad. Covid-19 entirely shifted the way we lived from our environment and stress levels to our friends, or the lack thereof.\n\n--\n\nAdditional Info\n\nMany times during the last two years, I've sacrificed my focus on education to prioritize family. I've never concentrated less on school than in 2021, my junior year and a time when I was supposed to be applying for college. \n\nMy mother was expecting my baby brother. My grandparents had just come to live with us. My elder sister was in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy as she had been diagnosed with lymphoma in March of 2021. My dad had been searching for work and found a restaurant space he would start leasing the same month of my sister's diagnosis. As the old saying goes, when it rains, it pours. \n\nMy typical day would consist of taking online classes while replying to customers of my e-commerce business and designing content or adjusting the website for my dad's restaurant. During the lunch break, I would pack orders, prepare them to ship out, and then have my actual lunch during my next class. After classes ended around 4:30, I'd go to the hospital to check up on my sister before rushing back home to get ready to work at the restaurant until eleven at night. My grandfather, who has Parkinson's and suffers from dementia, routinely forgets where he is and runs out of the house. Since my mom could not run after him, every few days, we'd have to come back early and try to find him walking through an empty street at night. \n\nObviously, this schedule left no time for studying and sometimes not even for homework. I remember staying up until 1 or 2 am after getting back to finish AP US History assignments. Since it was so impossible to retain information in class, I'd decided not to take the SAT and even skip one of three of my AP tests. I worked late nights the entire month of May, and the one day I missed work because I had an AP test in the morning was a disaster at the restaurant. \n\nSince I was little, I've been a straight A's, school-first student. Unfortunately, it became challenging to keep up with this mindset, but I'm happy that I learned through the obstacles and, as a result, became a more rigid and more well-rounded individual. \n\n--\n\nSMU Application:\nSMU appeals to students for a variety of reasons. Briefly describe why you are interested in attending SMU and what specific factors have led you to apply. (250-word limit)\\*\n\nSMU defines my intersection of interests and morals. \n \nOne aspect that stands out is that the Cox School of Business teachers have real-world experience in the industry. An opportunity to pick their brains and bounce ideas off my professors would greatly benefit me; experience stands as the best teacher. The University also puts an emphasis on diversity and pledges that \"Every Mustang Will Be Valued.\" Playing into that, the SMU Muslim Student Association has made efforts in raising charity for local refugees, something I can easily contribute to, given my background in the field. \n \nIt's also easy to start a new student organization not already present on campus. One of my first goals would be to create a blockchain club to explore the future of the Web3 movement with my peers. The Mustangs have also partnered with the NFTU program, showing the University is open to blockchain technology. A growth environment is\n\nMy sister, who attends Boston College, recommends finding a school with a college culture I'll remember. With SMU, I get the best of both worlds, a distinct, social culture while staying close to home. Recently, I met a professor at SMU at a community service event I took part in. She encouraged me to apply and check out the campus. When I visited, there was a college football game that night, and I got to see the enthusiasm in the community\u2014a sense of livelihood I have missed since moving from New York. \nSMU is a diverse learning environment shaped by the convergence of ideas and cultures. How will your unique experiences or background enhance the University, and how will you benefit from this community? (250-word limit)\\*\nI bring my passions, culture, and experiences to SMU. Sharing my journey with those around me and hearing theirs. Engaging in deep conversations about culture, religion, and ethics is nothing new to me and serves as an example to learn from. \n \nThe best way to gain wisdom is from people and the environment. Being a Pakistani who comes from a background valuing family above all, I've gotten the chance to learn from the extraordinary journeys of the many who've made the voyage to America. These are my favorite stories to hear, some came to the country with little money, and even less formal education yet were successful in their endeavors through hard work and determination. \n \nAn advantage I think about frequently is the exposure to various personalities as a teenager in the city of New York. Absorbing diverse concepts and ideals serves as a leg up on the majority that hasn't. Our backgrounds mold us into who we are. Moving five houses in less than 15 years doesn't sound ideal, but it made me who I am today, and looking back, I'm thankful for the situation it has put me in. \n \nI aim to continue discovering new personalities at SMU. There are numerous stories of people finding a founding team for their business by networking at their University. I'm hoping to accomplish the same, surrounding myself with people who can teach me concepts I'm unfamiliar with and vice-versa. Ideas build on each other, and that's how we change the world.\n--\nDMHP: Write a letter to your future self:\n\nHello Zuhair,\n\nI'm writing this letter in 2022, just a day before our 18th birthday. Just two days ago, I attended Converge22 in San Francisco with Spawn, and I'm now trying to catch up on all the work I missed while I was away. My current stresses will probably seem minor to you now, but I need to figure out how to do my Calculus homework by tomorrow, and my group for the Comets to the Core presentation didn't even start on our slides yet.\n\nIn my list of long-term goals, I have two specific ones that I'm currently working on. The first is to start working out regularly, and the second is to learn how to code. For the last two weeks, I have been waking up around 6:30 to go to the gym, and my days have been feeling a lot more productive. At Converge, many people I met recommended I pick up a coding language as a technical skill to back up my design expertise and my interest in technology. I'm trying to learn javascript, and hopefully, by the time you're reading this, I'm familiar with multiple programming languages. I think it would be a huge unlock for me to add to my knowledge and build upon, mainly because I've been experimenting with programs since a young age.\n\nYou have a lot on your hands right now, namely, doing marketing for Spawn and now the UTD Investments Club. E-commerce is also doing reasonably well, but, especially in the holiday season, I just don't have enough hours in the day to concentrate on everything at total capacity. This week I've had to be on so many zoom calls while we put in proposals for sponsorships at Spawn.\n\nAnyway, I hope all is well. Whatever you do, take care of your health and spend time with family.\n\nWishing you the best - Zuhair, 2022\nTell us about a community or group to which you belong. How have you contributed to this group, and how has it benefitted you?\n\nI owe a lot of my accomplishments to my community, without which I wouldn't merely be the person I am today. Back in New York, my family played a significant role in MANA (Memon Association of North America); this group of Memons --a minority Muslim ethnic group originating from Indian and Pakistani heritage. MANA aimed to remind community members of their South Asian roots and keep a close-knit group of familiar faces.\n\nFor my parents, when they first moved, these were the only people they interacted with outside of work. In a place like New York, it's easy to get lost in fast-paced city life and forget where you come from. Memons are known for being merchants back in South Asia, so naturally, many community members also used the gatherings to network and help each other with the business and find partners for their children. \n\nEveryone starts somewhere, and for graphic design, MANA was looking for someone to design a flyer for a sports event. My dad told me I should do it, but I had no idea where to begin. I used web-based software and would screenshot the result. Looking back now, using several different fonts and colors is not as artistic as it seemed back then, but every time I look back, I see progress. \n\nMANA got me started with graphic design, and I still use the skills I first learned today; I went from picking random website templates to making my own using Adobe Illustrator and now Figma. Just this week, I am wrapping up two freelance projects for restaurants that hired me to design their logo, menu, and promotional content, and it all started by volunteering to make a cricket event graphic. My interest in design has even brought me to web design and app design, I've started experimenting with UI, and I trust I'll make the journey just like I did with flyer design. \n\nI continue to make flyers for MANA even after moving to Dallas. I owe them everything I've achieved in the design space and even business-wise. I've met my best friends by going to the event and still talk to them over discord, we're all similar in our business-mindedness, and there's no doubt the community helped shape that.\n--\nWhether it is graphic design, business ideas, or even thinking up games to play with my cousins, I have always found ways to incorporate my concepts to improve what I'm doing. I have been writing theories in a book since I was 12 years old, including developing electric cars and blockchain technology to stop corrupt government practices. Sometimes I will take breaks just to imagine the future of our existence, our roadblocks, and our objectives for a better life. In doing so, I idealize business paths for my future that solve said problems using technology. Automation has also been a focal point for me as I am interested in problem-solving and keep an open mind to upcoming innovations.\n\nI started in graphic design in 2016, and it has taken a significant portion of my time over the years. I visualize my ideas through digital work and incorporate my business sense to market products. I've learned Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom, Final Cut Pro X, and Figma, all for this purpose. Today I have designed branding language for several successful companies and continue to use digital media to my strength. My campaigns tend to go outside of the box, resulting in higher click rates due to the creative nature of the advertisements.\n\n\nThey say, \"Curiosity killed the cat,\" but most don't know the end of the idiom: \"and satisfaction brought it back.\" Satisfaction eluding to the reward that one feels once they finally find the answer they were looking for. My curiosity works similarly, sometimes not allowing me to finish my work until I have found what I am searching for, even if it may seem irrelevant at the time. I often fight with myself for needing to know how everything works; However, the pleasure it brings once I figure it out has me outweighing the cost with the benefits. \n\nThe aspect of curiosity plays into my perfectionist persona. Everything must be top-notch, or I am left with the guilt of knowing I could have done better given a bit more time down the eternal rabbit hole. The price of curiosity does not come without its compensation, though; I believe if there is interest in a subject long enough, one will eventually become a beneficiary after investing their time and/or knowledge into a concept. \n\nMy curiosity ranges a broad spectrum with a passion for blockchain technology, efficient marketing strategy, and human psychology, to name a few. Given a chance, I will always investigate and ask questions about a field or idea that piques my interest, and once I start, there is no end in sight. Therefore the \"satisfaction\" is produced when I reach a milestone in the long journey.\n\nSelf-motivation is a concept most struggle with, though I think this is the most effective type of motive. This determination has brought itself to light in my life in various ways. Tying into the endless curiosity point, my character does not rest until I believe I have achieved the highest quality given my resources. There is always somewhere I can improve. No matter how hard I've worked, if the next day was not better than the last, then I am still failing. \n\nWhile I know it is impossible to reach perfection, this does not stop me from trying. I have an infinite amount of problems to solve and concepts to learn with less time every day, so I know if I stop pushing boundaries, they will push me.\n\nResiliency has played a factor in my school life where an 'A' could always become an 'A+,' and my presentations would take hours because the design and transitions had to be flawless. In business, I set goals for myself at 15 years old, much higher than I expected, only to hit them in a few months. A big part of that comes from the nature of my family; we've seen ups and downs, making us immune to the worst of times and cautious at the height. My mother always says, \"compare yourself only to who you were yesterday,\" meaning if I am not improving every day, I am falling behind. \n\nAt Syosset High School: \nDuring my time at Syosset High School, I could not become an officer of a club because of grade requirements. However, I did help out in the Investment club by raising funds after school, selling pizza. In the Entrepreneurship club, by getting four of my friends to join the club where we would meet with successful business people. \n\nAt Independence High School:\nWhile my time in-person at the school has been short, I have already reached out and met with the board of the National Honors Society board and am helping them create and logo for this year's merchandise using my graphic design knowledge. I enjoy this type of work as it helps me gain experience while also helping the community.\n\nElaborate on what you would like the college admission committee to know about you regarding personal qualities, unusual talents, academic strengths, community activities, etc\n\nMy university should know my story, the building blocks to who I am today. Having moved five homes, I have gotten a diverse look into the lives of others. Due to this, I can easily empathize with the challenges people face. In addition, I problem solve quicker than most after being exposed to multiple ways of doing a task. While a nomadic life may look stressful to most, it plays an advantage in developing my social consciousness. \n\nThe exposure has allowed me to contribute to community efforts, such as creating a fundraiser to supply food and essentials to those suffering in the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. My friends and I arranged boxes and negotiated with retailers to provide cost-effective supplies to give out. We utilized Facebook to search for those who needed help most at the time\u2014sometimes driving to Brooklyn, an hour drive from Long Island, just to deliver a box of food to a woman who just lost her job due to the circumstances. \n\nThen a monumental shift when my family moved to Dallas, but it was easy for me; I knew what had to be done and how to adapt. I was a pro at this point. Moving multiple times has allowed me to grasp a comprehensive view of the world and prepared me to adjust to my environment in the future. \n\nSome talents are genetic or even innate. Marketing represents this quality for me. It just seems right to me. Ever since I was young, I have been able to sell anything. At six years old, I traded my pokemon cards and snacks for what I thought was the better share of the deal. Today I run an e-commerce business selling electronics and apparel nationwide. It's just in my genes; it seems native. \nWhat do you consider to be your most important activity/(ies) outside of school? You may include jobs, religious activities, hobbies, and special talents. Why are these important to you? \n\nExperience came in many fields for me, mainly in the last two years of my life. In 2016 I volunteered to do graphic design and photography for a local community my family was involved in. Their goal was to involve more youth members using digital media. \n\nThe only problem was, I had no prior experience. I used web-based programs for the flyer designs, and I would use my sister's Nikon camera to shoot pictures for the photography. Later on, I'd go on to explore the depths of how I can use digital media.2 I learned photography, video editing, and some graphic design in just a couple of weeks. I was eager to learn, and designing seemed to come easily with my interest in tech. \n\nLittle did I know this volunteering changed everything for me. It took years to grasp some design and video editing concepts, many of which I don't even know today, but most beneficial was the start. A few years later, I was hired for some baking company to make Instagram posts. I would charge $20 for each. Looking back at it, I realize my prices were extremely low for the quality of work. \n\nDuring the same time, my friend had told me about the profitable business of reselling sneakers. I tried that and started using my graphic design experience to create high-ranking eBay listings for what I was selling. I didn't think much of it for some time...\n\nThen the world was hit with the COVID-19 pandemic. I started to help my dad shift his business because his sole source of income, physical cell phone stores, had to be shut down due to the state mandate. My dad and I would build a wholesale brand in March of 2020 to make an income. I would also explore resale opportunities on the side, separately, that I would start saving up and investing in. From some birthday money I was saving up for three years, I had managed to buy shoes, toys, and other limited, high-profit items. \n\nWhen we moved to Texas, I had some capital left after liquidating my small stock in New York. I made choices based on what we learned in class, and I would buy popular children's toys and games to prepare for the holiday season when supply would be low, but demand would skyrocket. The market was low on stock due to shipping difficulties regarding the pandemic, increasing the already high holiday premiums leading to my first 1,000 orders, all while attending virtual classes from my laptop. I would write my essays early in the morning to have enough time to package shipments for the afternoon. \n\n\nWhich high school teacher/class has impacted you most, and why/how?\n\nIn 10th grade, I took a College Marketing Class; this would be my first College Level course, earning me six credits by the end of the school year. The class would serve my interests and introduce new strategies to me. \n\nThrough the course, I gained the opportunity to be selected for a marketing and design competition\u2014a perfect blend of my skills. We were posed with creating a logo and rebranding strategy for an old Italian restaurant looking to open itself up to a younger crowd. Using my graphic design experience and my newly found marketing strategies, I worked a month on the poster board and elements to present. I would stay after school and come early to create what I thought was my best work at the time. \n\nI ended up getting 2nd place out of the 32 contestants that day. The only weakness in my display was my presenting skills; I had focused too much on the graphics and board aesthetics that I forgot to review the delivery. I'd be super observant in class for the rest of the course to up my presentation ability. I felt so defeated that I watched hours of presenters on YouTube for the next few months. I've watched TED Talks on every topic. Today, I am a confident presenter and can establish my presence acting as a magnet to watch and absorb.\n\nIn what ways are you more prepared to live independently than you were two years ago?\n\nFor most of last year, I already felt I was living independently. My sister was home from Boston College after getting diagnosed with Leukemia. My mother was expecting my younger brother. Meanwhile, my dad would search for work, and my little sister would be in school until 3:30. With my virtual classes in session, I would be responsible for making my meals and making enough for my mom and sisters. I realized afterward that the experience helped a lot with my time management skills, even experimenting by getting up earlier to give myself a head start on the day. I downloaded the Walmart+ app, so instead of going to the grocery store when my mom wasn't feeling well, we could just order groceries digitally, saving a lot of time and energy.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish in the future? What are your post-graduate plans?\n\nHave you ever heard of the 'Zone of Genius'? Gay Hendricks wrote about the concept in his book The Big Leap. Simply put, it is the point where all your skills and your 'innate genius' meet. The zone is what is most seems most effortless for you and difficult for the majority. To bring it to its potential, we must practice our natural talent and blend it with our passions. For me, that is Graphic Design and Marketing paired with my interest in blockchain technology. Along with some friends, I have already started building a project utilizing the technology, and I have so many ideas on how to implement it into everyone's daily life. \n\nBlockchain is my future because it is ultimately humanity's future. The technology is our only hope to introduce a transparent commerce system when the people in power prefer to hide their shady dealings. It solves the problem of corruption and resolves some of the power of giant corporations. Blockchain technology can't be stopped, and nor can I.\n\nThe only thing I know for certain is that blockchain will be involved in my future; the rest is flexible. Given the adaptable nature I eluded earlier, I am willing to go where life takes me. \n\nWhat other information would be helpful for your counselor to know? Difficulties overcome, struggles, mitigating circumstances, passions... Be sure to mention if you moved to our school during HS, if you have a disability, or if anything else has impacted your GPA. \n\nMy GPA would look better if I did not engage in multiple out-of-school activities last year. I would work on my e-commerce business for a significant portion of the day, leaving less time for school work and studying. The only day I took off was the day of my AP test. Had I portioned the time out for studying instead of working, I would see the results in my favor. However, I decided on my future as I believe the experience I gained combats a few percentage points. \n\nThe same goes for my SAT, I probably should have studied when I was working, but I did not. I took my first SAT this year with no PSAT before. Decisions were made; I can't tell if they were good ones until the future.\n\nAs for my Freshman and Sophomore grades, I am pretty satisfied knowing the rigorous courses offered there. I never missed honor roll any quarter, and knowing how competitive the school was, it felt like an outstanding achievement. The classes were challenging, and I knew no one with a perfect GPA there. \n\nHowever, I learned that Frisco School District often allows retests on every exam until a student reaches 100% and uses other tactics such as 'waterfalling' to ensure no student fails. Therefore my GPA will be lower than most of the others because my former school did not allow such practices. Although this is the case, I won't let it worry me as it will push me harder to come out on top.", "Here's an article that may help:\nFive Examples of Transfer Apply Texas Essay A Statement of Purpose\nDSC\\_0201\\_1.JPG\nUT requires all prospective external transfer students to write a 500-750 word response to Apply Texas Essay A:\n\nThe statement of purpose will provide an opportunity to explain any extenuating circumstances that you feel could add value to your application.

I felt the familiarity of being alone. Each time I change environments, it doesn\u2019t come any easier. A broad-shouldered girl in a blue shirt asked accusingly me where I needed to be. Despite intimidating me at first, she turned out to be sweet and concerned for my well-being. \n\nShe took me to my classroom and introduced me to the other girls. They all seemed so different from me. My family left the United States when I was young, and during my ten years spent in India, I switched between three very different schools.\n\nAccustomed to American schools that are relatively orderly and organized, it took time to adjust to India\u2019s disorderly schools. Just as I started feeling comfortable with the unusual teaching methods of my new school, my parents transferred me to a more \u201ccultural\u201d school. With a total of seven students in the entire school, we learned in literal shacks. \n\nMy classmates were behind in their education and far below my grade level, so the teachers focused most of their time on them. I suffered greatly when I switched back into mainstream schooling. Now, it was my classmates who raced through their work. I was thrown, unprepared, into India\u2019s rigorous education system. I struggled with constructing angles and balancing chemical equations. I had to work especially hard to make up for the time lost at my cultural school. \n\nI made it through Tenth grade with extensive additional coaching. Despite my setback, I knew that I could do better. Through my classes, I began to develop an interest with the mathematical functions that power finance and accounting. My accounting teacher became my biggest inspiration. The way she related accounting procedures to current business crises convinced me to learn more. I started keeping up with companies\u2019 corporate strategies and their effect on the economy. \n\nBefore my board exams, I completed additional work on my own and solved about 70 papers in preparation. The work ethic I acquired under her guidance is something that has stuck to me through the challenging times at community college. I continue to self-study with online courses offered on Khan Academy to further exceed expectations.\n\nAdditionally, my internship at the Pratham International School in the summer of 2016 gave me real-world experience with auditing and organizing financials. I applied my classroom and self-studying knowledge to help with vendor payment methods and profitable tuition pricing. \n\nI also pursued an internship in the accounting department of The Home Depot. For the first time, I saw theoretical concepts come to life as I helped facilitate vendor payment methods and profitable product pricing. The chance to interact with higher level financial managers gave me exposure to strategic decision making and contingency planning. \n\nI look forward to pursuing another internship and taking advantage of the connections provided by the McCombs School of Business. I hope the university will help connect me with fruitful opportunities to develop my business competencies. By participating in the Texas Stock Team and The University Finance Association, I can explore different interests and develop my network. I don\u2019t have these opportunities at Houston Community College, and I don\u2019t think any Texas university offers the unparalleled opportunities of UT. Doing research under award winning professors like Laura Starks and Robert Parrino will give me a head start in the industry. \n\nLike The University of Texas, I also want to transform myself and change the world. The past few months at the Houston community college have helped me realize that I need an environment with a limitless ceiling for growth. Since I have experienced many different educational environments, I have a good idea for what I seek while avoiding opportunities that may not be in my best interest. I bring a different perspective that will contribute to classroom discussions and be a valued addition to the McCombs community.\n\nCommentary\nI clearly remember this student\u2019s dramatic admissions decision. UT actually released almost all of their rejections and acceptances by early June, yet this applicant didn\u2019t hear back until a week later. \n\nWe both assumed that wasn\u2019t good news, but we were pleasantly surprised that they received a last minute acceptance into the McCombs School of Business. I have no doubt that their Essay A Statement of Purpose and resume tipped the scales in their favor despite their below average GPA.\n\nThey cover a lot of territory discussing being raised in two different countries and attending three different schools with radically different environments before transitioning back to Texas and attending HCC. They touch on independent studies and a relevant internship that informs their prospective major and career goals.\n\nThey also do a nice job of describing how their current college has a low ceiling and will not allow them to achieve their long-term goals. They\u2019ve done their homework by supplying a few informative \u201cWhy UT\u201d statements concerning student organizations and professors to help reviewers imagine how this student might contribute to the Forty Acres.\n\nThroughout, they argue convincingly that they know where they want to go, how they bring diverse perspectives to campus, and why UT is their best fit university.\n\nCheck out my new book Surviving the College Admissions Madness and Youtube Channel\n\nFour-Year Liberal Arts Admit 4.0 GPA\nMy decision to enroll at the University of North Texas was ill\u2013informed. Initially, I believed that, far enough away from my family yet close enough to return home every few weeks, I could grow on my terms. This unfortunate decision was fostered by my perspective of academic environments and the \u201ccollege life.\u201d I believed a university education was something purely academic, never multifaceted. \n\nAs someone who has never considered myself particularly school\u2013spirited, I did not feel the need to be connected to any larger community. I viewed my transition to college simply as a stepping stone to the next chapter of my life, a means to an end and not something inherently valuable. \n\nI chose UNT by process of elimination. I wanted to attend a Texas public university, but not as close as San Marcos and Austin or even College Station or Houston. However, the more time I spent in Denton, the more I realized that there was a low ceiling for my potential to grow. I felt like a \u201cbig fish in a small pond\u201d and my development, both intellectual and social, stalled. \n\nI have always aspired to something greater, something more challenging, something different. These aspirations, unfortunately, were not able to be experienced at UNT. My courses were stagnant, easy, \u201cgo with the flow\u201d\u2013\u2013the exact opposite of what I needed. Most students around me, even those within the Honors College, did not study for major exams or complete their assignments on time. It made me restless and uneasy. \n\nAs time wore on, I concluded I was not finding the challenges I originally sought. I refused to settle into the mediocre routines around me and merely coast along with strong, yet hollow grades. The more I considered and explored my academic goals and future, the clearer it became that only the University of Texas offers the rigor and challenge that I seek. \n\nThis fall, I visited the 40 Acres and immediately noticed a striking difference. Nearly every other student I came across wore burnt orange; people walked confidently and actually socialized on campus. There seemed to be a school spirit that was conspicuously absent at UNT. The University of Texas felt like a family, a cohesive yet still fiercely individualistic unit. Even with a just a two\u2013hour visit to the 40 Acres, I could already feel its infectious energy creeping up inside me, a feeling I would not soon forget.\n\nI had not considered that a university experience could be both academically enriching and spiritually fulfilling. Instantly, I knew where I needed to call home. My fascination and excitement was furthered with the University of Texas when I researched the Anthropology Department. I was amazed at the never\u2013ending opportunities for research. For example, Dr. Courtney Handman\u2019s focus on linguistic anthropology and her examination of recently\u2013converted Protestant indigenous communities in rural Papua New Guinea related to my interests of languages, religion, and their convergence.\n\nMy passion with linguistic anthropology began when I was nine years old when my parents took me on my first international trip. We traveled throughout Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain, Sicilia, and Croatia. With each country, there was an entire new method of communication, an entirely new way of life. \n\nExposure to different cultures and languages, however, was not an entirely new concept. I live in a bilingual home. My father grew up in Madrid and learned both Spanish and English. My father wanted to share a vital part of his identity and childhood with me, and we communicate primarily in Spanish. Later, I became unsatisfied with only speaking two languages, and self\u2013studied French. \n\nBy the time I entered high school, I could converse fluently with both my French and Spanish teachers. These experiences continue to shape and inform my desire to balance the arts and sciences by studying linguistic anthropology before enrolling in medical school.\u2003\n\nCommentary\nSince they are applying to a non-STEM program with a 4.0, it isn\u2019t necessary for this applicant to discuss their grades or relevant coursework. Despite having a high chance of gaining admission based on their grades, they leave little room for doubt by submitting a thoughtful essay that describes honestly their decision to attend UNT and why that isn\u2019t working out.\n\nIt\u2019s a balanced essay that focuses equally on where they\u2019re coming from and how UT can help them explore their interests and achieve their long-term goals. Any time a transfer applicant is coming from a four-year university, its important to discuss tastefully why they don\u2019t feel their current university is a good fit. We worked for a while on striking the right tone.\n\nTo discuss why UT is a great fit and why you want to transfer often requires developing why you\u2019re currently dissatisfied. Their reviewer can no doubt relate to their story of not knowing what they want as a high school student and how attending college gives them an idea of what they don\u2019t prefer moving forward.\n\nUT has extensive study abroad and language programs, and they develop well how UT offers resources not accessible at any other public university. They demonstrate how their current studies and travels abroad inform them that although they want to change universities, they want to continue majoring in Anthropology.\n\nInterested in working together?

It took three minutes to arrive at the base of the towering skyscraper. I sighed, disappointed, and accepted this final defeat to cap a dispiriting senior year as I nervously navigated through the downtown underground labyrinth.\n\nLike many of my classmates, I spent most of my high school years working tirelessly in hopes of attending a prestigious university. With each rejection letter, I wasn\u2019t sure any university would admit me. Receiving CAP stung particularly. I questioned the point of studying so long for my SAT and ACT and taking a few AP courses that didn\u2019t particularly interest me. Reluctantly, I submitted the deposit to my safety school. \n\nI walked to my car that day feeling like I've lost before I even started. Even getting to my interview proved frustrating. I had never visited downtown Houston. Battling traffic and tricky one-ways, I found the parking garage, slid into a space without bumping my neighbors and stumbled through the building before finding the first set of elevators, \u201cSky Lobby.\u201d I boarded. A man in his forties joined followed quickly by a college-aged student. More men and women filed in until we crunched together shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nI felt out of place, and dad\u2019s suit didn\u2019t fit right - sleeves too long and shoulder pads jutting below my neck. Everyone appeared so confident. People talked over one another as they discussed seemingly important things like upcoming meetings and lunch plans. Noises blended, a hum of indistinct chatter. After three deafening minutes of chit-chat, a merciful ding signaled our arrival. The doors glided inwards.\n\nA nervous silence preceded a burst of sunlight. I stepped into the panoramic atrium offering a birds-eye view of Houston, the Sky Lobby. Despite living in Houston for my entire life, I could never have imagined the city so beautiful. I absorbed the scenes below \u2013 the bustling traffic, the diverging currents of the bayou snaking in the distance, and the impersonal skyscrapers dotting the vista, silently taunting our unrestricted zoning laws. I swear I could almost see the curvature of the Earth, two million people all in my field of view.\n\nA friendly voice interrupted my gaze. The secretary welcomed me into a grand office that may have passed for a museum. The next moments were a blank. A blurred, neurotic, sweaty blank. Slowly, I walked back to the elevator wide-eyed, almost bewildered. \n\nWhile planning my classes at university I never really hoped to attend, I heard a ding signaling the arrival of an email on my phone. \u201cProbably some more spam,\u201d I thought. The title betrayed great news, \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\n\nIn his concluding remarks at a Dillard University commencement speech, the great Denzel Washington advised, \u201cDon\u2019t aspire to make a living. Aspire to make a difference.\u201d These words now stick to me like glue. Looking back to when those elevator doors first opened, I believe it was at that moment, with the city at my fingertips, that I aspired to make a difference.\n\nBefore, I viewed education as a means to an end, a minor footnote in my transition to the professional world. After that day, I saw the bigger picture. A purposeful education produces change within and bettering the world around me. At Houston Endowment, I learned the ins and outs of the workings of a non-profit foundation. I even had the privilege of personally speaking one-on-one with non-profit executives around Houston. While my internship is generally reserved for students at the end of their college careers, I was able to gain exposure to community and business leaders that have shown me that thoughtful, long-term efforts can make the world a better place. \n\nFrom the first moment each Longhorn arrives on the 40 Acres, they receive the message that \u201cWhat starts here changes the world.\u201d What\u2019s so brilliant about this motto is that it gives the beholder freedom to interpret their place at the university, their communities, and how their education produces ripples of change throughout the world. \n\nIt seems to me that to be a Longhorn means to be a leader. To be that which \u201cchanges the world.\u201d I don\u2019t feel a similar sense of purpose and community at UH, and feel the path to being leader lies in Austin. With the experiences I gained from my descent into Houston\u2019s philanthropic heart, I intend to hone my dream to be the leader of change that UT trains all its students to be. \n\nCommentary\nI like this essay a lot because it shares a compelling story that frames where they\u2019ve come from academically and professionally, where they currently are, and how UT can help them achieve their goals. They also discussed why they enrolled at the University of Houston, their home city, rather than pursuing UT-Austin\u2019s Coordinated Admissions Program.\n\nThey have strong statements throughout that they\u2019re deserving of a space in admissions. They discuss how they will bring a unique perspective to campus and how they seem themselves as a leader on the Forty Acres. They also touch on how their academic goals and beliefs have evolved over time, transitioning from \u201cseeing education as a means to an end\u201d to one where education is a value in itself.\n\nIt\u2019s a well-written response that no doubt helped their reviewer form a mental image of the student. It solicits empathy. Everyone can relate to the nervousness of being out of their element and receiving pleasant surprising news when they were otherwise doubtful.\n\nDespite their below average GPA, there\u2019s no doubt they gained admission on the strength of this Essay A that helped connect their expanded resume and Essay E about growing up in a mixed-religions household.\n\nInterested in building your best transfer application? Complete my questionnaire for a free consultation.\n\nMoody College of Communications Admitted Transfer 3.3 GPA \nI am currently enrolled as a first-year student at Collin College in Frisco, Texas, and I want to finish my studies at the University of Texas in Austin majoring in public relations.\n\nMy decision to attend Collin stemmed from my mediocre grades in high school \u2013 I wanted a fresh start at a college close to home. Though I was accepted at a few well-ranked Texas public universities, I had higher aspirations. I felt that I could improve my grade point average while completing prerequisite courses transferable anywhere. I lived at home allowing me to save money, help my family, and continue working at my job.\n\nDue to my family\u2019s dire financial situation, I initially wanted to pursue a degree in business and finance solely to be more financially secure and allow me the opportunity to raise my own family someday. I took several business-related classes in high school and college. My goal has always been to transfer to UT and earn a degree in finance. \n\nIn preparation for transfer, I took Algebra, Pre-calculus, and Calculus 1 and 2. Math is not my strongest subject, and I found Pre-calculus and Calculus to be especially difficult. Despite joining a study group and meeting with the professor but, unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t enough. My low math grades are not for lack of effort. \n\nAt the time, I was taking care of my mother, a single parent, and coordinating her transfer to rehab for alcohol addiction. I became the head of household responsible for caring for my three younger sisters. I became a full-time student, employee, and house mom. Instead of getting discouraged by my setback in calculus, I saw it as an opportunity to grow and reconsider my future. I realized that if math isn\u2019t my strong suit, I probably won\u2019t enjoy a career in banking. I feel like many of my friends want to go to business school, but don\u2019t actually enjoy the work or have the skills required to be a successful student. I felt that my decision to pursue finance came not from my own motivations, but pressures from friends, family, and society. \n\nI considered my strengths, and now I understand that I love communicating with people and solving problems. I\u2019m the go-to person in my friend group when relationships end or problems happen at school, and I am used to handling family crises at home. I want to help solve problems on behalf of companies, and I feel that public relations is my perfect fit.\n\nI learned to communicate effectively at an early age. No matter what situation my family was going through, my sisters and other relatives considered my opinions and often put my suggestions into practice. My survival and quality of life depends on resolving conflicts for work, for my internship, and for relaying messages within a divided family. Recognizing my strength, I feel that public relations would be the perfect major for me. \n\nTo gain firsthand experience and test my decision, I took on a Public Relations/Blogger Relations internship for Conscious Couture. Through reaching out to bloggers that have PR firms, I am reassured that I made the right decision and have truly found what I love. Also, I have previous professional experience as an executive assistant for Texas Family Fitness. I was constantly phoning clients, communicating with employees, setting up meetings, proposing new ideas, and managing conflict in the workplace. \n\nAfter doing research, I learned that UT has one of the best public relations departments and employs world-renowned faculty. I especially like the internship requirement and career placement resources. My goal is to begin with a major public relations firm and, ultimately, establish my own firm. If I decide to continue my studies after my bachelor\u2019s, the LBJ School of Public Affairs seems like an appealing way to transition into government work. \n\nCommentary\nThis particular student had a 3.0 by the deadline, and since they had less than 24 hours completed, UT waited to make their decision after receiving their spring grades. They made a D in Calculus, so this essay helps put that grade into context.\n\nI appreciate that this essay is very straightforward. They get right to the point why they are at their current university, what they hope to study at UT, and how their goals evolved over time.\n\nOne pitfall of extenuating circumstances essays is they tend towards hyperbole and overexageration. This applicant provides balance and nuance to their issues at home and concrete ways that they\u2019ve developed and matured over time. They also link their special circumstances into their proposed major, Public Relations.\n\nThey also develop well how their professional experiences and internship further influence their decision to transfer. Their Essay A complements and provides context to their expanded resume. They argue convincingly that UT is the best fit for them because of its strong academics while still being close enough to home to visit on the weekends.\n\nPutting their poor calculus grade into context, articulating but not going overboard about their special circumstances, and demonstrating their fit for major undoubtedly played a major role in them gaining admission to UT.\n\nCheck out my new book Surviving the College Admissions Madness and Youtube Channel\n\nOOS Moody College of Communications Admit 3.41 GPA\nIt was early in 2016 and I needed a job. Seton Hall \u2013 my current university \u2013 costs about $14,000 per semester just for tuition. Growing up with the potential to be the first in my family to attend college, I never took college enrollment for granted. I saw the financial burden my decision placed on my parents. I came across a job listing for a Human Resources Policy Management Resource for Johnson & Johnson. After a rigorous interview process, they offered me one of three openings among hundreds of college-educated applicants. It was a long shot since I don\u2019t study business and I lack professional experience. My position was no mere internship; I began working in March as a full-time contractor. \n\nWith no awareness of the corporate world, I had to learn office politics, bureaucracy, and division of responsibilities on the fly. I updated human resources policies from Johnson & Johnson\u2019s global business holdings and received approval from the policy owner and the legal department. Next, we worked with translators from 30+ languages to convert the documents into their language of origin. Finally, I uploaded the policies onto the HR Portal for the thousands of employees to see. \n\nI functioned as the liaison between policy owners and J&J, including those in non-English speaking countries, who were operating in different time zone. Working cross-culturally can be a challenge, but I learned quickly. I stayed organized and met intense deadlines assigned to my team by the Vice President of Global HR Services. I worked thirty to forty hours each week while taking a full course load. \n\nBefore my Johnson & Johnson contract expired, the Director of Human Resources, impressed with my work, suggested that I interview for another position. I received a job offer; however, Jeffery Vanderbeek, the former Vice President of the Lehman Brothers and former Chairman and Owner of the New Jersey Devils, called me. Nearing retirement, he recently accepted the football head coach position at Somerville High School near my hometown. Jeff heard about an online radio station I started for my alma matter Immaculata High School. He offered me a job on the spot to run the communications efforts for Somerville Football. I accepted with much excitement so I could continue pursuing my communications passion.\n\nI began by building a website and managing their nascent social media channels. I started producing a weekly documentary series following their progress during the season. I hired and managed two media interns. I divided responsibilities and maintained our daily schedule to keep our workflow moving smoothly. Some might write this off as merely doing work for a High School team, but I disagree. \n\nI answered every day to a man who occupied corner offices atop Wall Street skyscrapers and oversaw operating budgets in the tens of billions of dollars. He asked same of me as with his Lehman Brothers partners. While that could understandably be stressful, working for Johnson and Johnson prepared me for adapting to pressure and navigating powerful personalities. \n\nSomerville and Mr. Vanderbeek helped me become a team player and showcase the best side of their football team. Mr. Vanderbeek served as a mentor to me and everyday pushed me to achieve more. I am eternally grateful for his lessons on leadership and how, with ambition and hard work, I can also rise to the top to my future career, broadcasting.\n\nI visited UT in October and immediately felt at home. I sat impressed through a taping for Texas Student Television in the Moody College of Communications. I had been around video production for a number of years, but never had I seen such a group of talented professionals my age working so passionately. It really brought about much excitement within me and reignited the fire I have for the profession. The RTF program at UT is a world-class education with deep industry connections. It is where I need to be.\n\nCommentary\nLike the previous example, this straightforward essay addresses all of the things that UT reviewers are looking for. They discuss the context and buyer\u2019s remorse about attending an expensive private university, but they don\u2019t dwell on it. \n\nInstead, they focus on their strengths - pursuing a highly selective and well-paying internship and relevant social media/broadcasting examples. Since they had an influential mentor who also submitted a reference letter, their Essay A develops well their argument that they are prepared to succeed at UT-Austin.\n\nThey applied as an out-of-state student from New Jersey, so they also address in their last paragraph how UT can help them achieve their goals. Providing specific observations from their visit let\u2019s the review know that they are making an informed decision to transfer.\n\nAlthough they changed their major from RTF to Journalism after arriving on campus, they secured a recent, highly prestigious internship at the CBS Morning Show in Manhattan. They are also involved with Texas Student Television, so there\u2019s no doubt UT extending this student an offer pays dividends for the university. \n\nUT-Austin utilizes the transfer process to bring leaders onto campus who can introduce different perspectives to classroom discussions and student organizations.", "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nThe Secret Invasion\nThe Secret Invasion is a 1964 American war film directed by Roger Corman. It stars Stewart Granger, Raf Vallone, Mickey Rooney, Edd Byrnes, Henry Silva, Mia Massini, and William Campbell. Appearing three years before The Dirty Dozen (1967), the film features a similar World War II mission where convicts are recruited by the Allies for an extremely hazardous operation behind enemy lines.\n\nPlot\nIn 1943, British Intelligence in Cairo recruits Italian  criminal mastermind Roberto Rocca, demolitions expert and Irish Republican Army member Terence Scanlon, forger Simon Fell, cold-blooded assassin John Durrell, and thief and impersonator Jean Saval for a dangerous mission. The men are offered pardons in exchange for attempting to rescue an Italian general sympathetic to the Allies who is imprisoned in German-occupied Yugoslavia. The group is led by Major Richard Mace, who is trying to expiate his feelings of guilt for sending his own brother on a dangerous mission and waiting too long to extricate him. The fishing boat transporting Mace's team is stopped by a patrol boat, but they dispose of the Germans.\nWith the assistance of local partisans led by Marko, they split up and enter Dubrovnik. Durrell is partnered with Mila, a recent widow with a baby. They are attracted to each other, but Durrell becomes extremely distraught when he accidentally smothers her crying child to avoid detection by a German patrol. The team is captured and taken to the same fortress where the Italian general is being kept. They are tortured for information, but manage to escape and fulfill their mission, although Mace, Mila, Fell, Scanlon, and Saval are killed while fending off German troops.\nAt the last minute, Rocca and Durrell discover that the man they have freed is an impostor, and he is about to exhort \"his\" troops to stay loyal to the Axis. Durrell pretends to be a Nazi fanatic and shoots the fake general; he is killed by the outraged Italians. Rocca, the last man standing, directs the Italians' anger to the Germans.\n\nCast\nProduction\nAfter turning out a treatment based on the locale of Dubrovnik, Roger Corman teamed with screenwriter R. Wright Campbell who had a project, Dubious Patriots about a wartime mission involving convicts. The script was taken over by producer David V. Picker at United Artists, who was able to leverage the screenplay into a well-financed studio production. With a budget of $600,000, more than twice more than he had for his earlier independently-funded features, Corman was able to start production in between his Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, The Masque of the Red Death and The Tomb of Ligeia (1964).The original cast was Mickey Rooney, Raf Vallone, Edd Byrnes and Bobby Darin. Brendan Behan was to be adviser for scenes set at Borstal Prison. It was Byrnes first role after his contract with Warner Bros ended.In August 1963 it was announced that Darin had pulled out of the film on the orders of his doctor, and he was replaced by Henry Silva. Also that month Stewart Granger signed to star.Principal photography under the working title of Dubious Patriots took place on location in Dubrovnik and other parts of Yugoslavia in the summer of 1963 for a typically short Corman shooting schedule of 36 days. With the assistance of the Yugoslavian government, a large number of military personnel and equipment were offered, but an earthquake threatened to delay the production when troops were siphoned off to help in the relief effort.Corman's problems extended to not only wrangling military extras, but also to dealing with the emotions of a star like Stewart Granger \"stooping\" to make a \"B film\" and worrying that his role was not as prominent as the others in the ensemble cast. At one point, Corman actually rewrote his part \"on the spot\" so that Granger had more lines than Edd Byrnes, his co-star, who was a current popular television star.The production was photographed in Panavision with Eastmancolor film.(Gene Corman later reused the title The Dubious Patriots for another film he made with Tony Curtis and Charles Bronson.)\n\nReception\nIn a contemporary review of The Secret Invasion, The New York Times film reviewer Howard Thompson saw some positives in what was basically a \"programmer\": \n\n... a rather surprising amount of brisk muscularity and panoramic color, if not always credibility. The casting of this United Artists release, which arrived at the Criterion and other houses, may make some customers blink and wait for the worst ... But they, and the picture, do pretty well, considering.\n\nIn Brassey's Guide to War Films, film historian Alun Evans considered the production exemplified Corman's ability to \"... create something out of nothing.\" He also noted that The Secret Invasion has some notoriety as  \"... the  sawn-off antecedent of The Dirty Dozen.\"\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1964\nFive Guns West, an earlier Roger Corman movie of essentially the same plot\nPassage 2:\nRyoichi Hattori (politician)\nRyoichi Hattori (\u670d\u90e8\u826f\u4e00, Hattori Ryoichi, born February 24, 1950) is a Japanese politician of the Social Democratic Party.

Yates (September 16, 1918 \u2013 June 2, 2006) was an American television director who was the director of the ABC television program American Bandstand from 1952 until 1969.\n\nBiography\nYates became a still photographer after graduating from high school in 1936. After serving in World War II, he became employed by Philadelphia's WFIL-TV as a boom microphone operator. He was later promoted to cameraman (important as most programming was done live and local during the early years of television) and earned a bachelor's degree in communications in 1950 from the University of Pennsylvania.\nIn October 1952, Yates volunteered to direct Bandstand, a new concept featuring local teens dancing to the latest hits patterned after the \"950 Club\" on WPEN-AM. The show debuted with Bob Horn as host and took off after Dick Clark, already a radio veteran at age 26, took over in 1956.\nIt was broadcast live in its early years, even after it became part of the ABC network's weekday afternoon lineup in 1957 as American Bandstand. Yates pulled records, directed the cameras, queued the commercials and communicated with Clark via a private line telephone located on his podium.\nIn 1964, Clark moved the show to Los Angeles, taking Yates with him.\nYates retired from American Bandstand in 1969, and moved his family to the Philadelphia suburb of West Chester.\nHe died in 2006 at a nursing home where he had been for the last two months of his life.\n\nExternal links\nEdward Yates at IMDb\nPassage 4:\nBen Palmer\nBen Palmer (born 1976) is a British film and television director.\nHis television credits include the Channel 4 sketch show Bo' Selecta!

Known under various monikers such as \"The Pope of Pop Cinema\", \"The Spiritual Godfather of the New Hollywood\", and \"The King of Cult\", he is known as a trailblazer in the world of independent film. Many of Corman's films are based on works that have an already-established critical reputation, such as his cycle of low-budget cult films adapted from the tales of Edgar Allan Poe.In 1964, Corman\u2014admired by members of the French New Wave and Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\u2014became the youngest filmmaker to have a retrospective at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise, as well as in the British Film Institute and the Museum of Modern Art. He was the co-founder of New World Pictures, the founder of New Concorde and is a longtime member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2009, he was awarded an Honorary Academy Award \"for his rich engendering of films and filmmakers\".Corman is also famous for distributing in the U.S. many foreign directors, such as Federico Fellini (Italy), Ingmar Bergman (Sweden), Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut (France) and Akira Kurosawa (Japan). He mentored and gave a start to many young film directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, Peter Bogdanovich, Joe Dante, John Sayles, and James Cameron, and was highly influential in the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s and 1970s. He also helped to launch the careers of actors like Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper, Bruce Dern, Diane Ladd, and William Shatner. Corman has occasionally taken minor acting roles in the films of directors who started with him, including The Silence of the Lambs, The Godfather Part II, Apollo 13, The Manchurian Candidate, and Philadelphia.A documentary about Corman's life and career entitled Corman's World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel, directed by Alex Stapleton, premiered at the Sundance and Cannes Film Festivals in 2011. The film's TV rights were picked up by A&E IndieFilms after a well-received screening at Sundance.\n\nEarly life\nCorman was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Anne (n\u00e9e High) and William Corman, an engineer. His younger brother, Gene, produced numerous films, sometimes in collaboration with Roger. Corman and his brother were raised Catholic.Corman went to Beverly Hills High School and then to Stanford University to study industrial engineering. While at Stanford, Corman realized he did not want to be an engineer. He enlisted in the V-12 Navy College Training Program with six months of study to complete. After serving in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946, he returned to Stanford to finish his degree, receiving a Bachelor of Science in industrial engineering in 1947. While at Stanford University, Corman was initiated in the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon.\nIn 1948, he worked briefly at U.S. Electrical Motors on Slauson Avenue in Los Angeles, but his career in engineering lasted only four days; he began work on Monday and quit on Thursday, telling his boss \"I've made a terrible mistake.\" Gene Corman was already working in the film industry as an agent, and Roger decided to go into filmmaking instead.\n\nEarly film career\nCorman found work at 20th Century Fox initially in the mail room. He worked his way up to a story reader. The one property that he liked the most and provided ideas for was filmed as The Gunfighter with Gregory Peck. When Corman received no credit at all, he left Fox and decided he would work in film by himself. Under the G.I. Bill, Corman studied English literature at Oxford University and lived in Paris for a time.\n\nHe then returned to Los Angeles and tried to re-establish himself in the film industry. He took various jobs, including television stagehand at KLAC and a messenger at Fox. He worked as an assistant to agent Dick Hyland, a literary agent.\n\nHighway Dragnet\nCorman wrote a script in his spare time and sold it to William F. Broidy at Allied Artists for $2,000. \"Dick thought it was funny and let me pay myself a commission,\" said Corman. Originally called House in the Sea, it was retitled Highway Dragnet (1953) and starred Richard Conte and Joan Bennett. Corman also worked as associate producer on the film for nothing, just for the experience.\n\nProducer\nCorman used his script fee and personal contacts to raise $12,000 to produce his first feature, a science-fiction film, Monster from the Ocean Floor (1954). It was produced by Corman's own company, Palo Alto, and released by Robert L. Lippert.\nThe film did well enough to encourage Corman to produce another film, the racing-car thriller The Fast and the Furious (1955), directed by its star, John Ireland, and co-starring Dorothy Malone. Decades later, producer Neal H. Moritz and Universal Pictures licensed the title for the 2001 film, The Fast and the Furious, which eventually spawned a huge franchise. Moritz had difficulty choosing between proposed titles Racer X, Redline, Race Wars, and Street Wars, and was inspired by a documentary on American International Pictures that included Corman's film. Moritz was able to trade the use of some stock footage to Corman for use of the title.Corman sold the movie to a new independent company, the American Releasing Company (ARC), run by James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff. Although Corman had a number of offers for the film from Republic and Columbia, he elected to go with ARC because they undertook to advance money to enable him to make two more movies.\n\nDirector\nCorman's second film for ARC was one he decided to direct, Five Guns West (1955), a Western, made in color for around $60,000, with Malone and John Lund. The script was written by Robert Wright Campbell, who worked with Corman on several more occasions.\nCorman announced he would make four more projects for ARC: High Steel, Cobra, Fortress Beneath the Sea, and an untitled film from Campbell. Instead, Corman did some uncredited directing on The Beast with a Million Eyes (1955), then made another Western, Apache Woman (1955), starring Lloyd Bridges, written by Lou Rusoff. Rusoff and Corman reunited on Day the World Ended (1955), a postapocalyptic science-fiction film, which was popular.\nCorman was to make The Devil on Horseback by Charles B. Griffith about the Brownsville Raid, but it was too expensive.\nThe Woolner Brothers, Louisiana drive-in owners, financed Corman's Swamp Women (1956), a girls-on-the-lam saga.\nHe returned to ARC for two Westerns, The Oklahoma Woman (1956) and Gunslinger (1956) (with Ireland); Gunslinger was co-written by Griffith, who became a crucial collaborator with Corman over the next five years. He bought a script from Curtis Harrington, The Girl from Beneath the Sea. Harrington made it for Corman years later as Night Tide (1961).\nBeverly Garland, one of Corman's early regular stock players, recalled working with him:\n\nRoger made us work hard and long, I remember that! He was always fascinating to me, a fascinating man \u2013 and a good businessman! He had such incredible energy, it was tremendous \u2013 he was a dynamo to be around. I always knew he was going to be a huge success because there was no stopping him. He just made up his mind that he was going to be a success and that was it.\n\nAmerican International Pictures and Allied Artists\nARC changed its name to American International Pictures. Corman was established as their leading filmmaker. They financed Corman's next film as director, the science-fiction story It Conquered the World (1956). Co-written by Griffith, it was a follow-up to The Day the World Ended. It was a big hit.\nHe optioned a TV play, The Stake, and hoped to get Dana Andrews to star. It was never made. Instead, Walter Mirisch of Allied Artists hired Corman to make The Undead (1957), inspired by The Search for Bridey Murphy. Griffith wrote the script.\nIn June, Corman made a science-fiction film for Allied Artists,  Not of this Earth (1957), written by Griffith.\nIn August 1956, AIP financed a Corman heist movie shot in Hawaii, Naked Paradise (1957), co-written by Griffith. Corman shot it back-to-back with a movie made with his own money, She Gods of Shark Reef (1958). Corman wound up selling the movie to AIP.\nCorman and Griffith reunited in Attack of the Crab Monsters (1957) for Allied, which wound up being one of his most successful early films.For his own production company, Corman made a rock-and-roll \"quickle\", Carnival Rock (1957), released by Howco. Rock All Night (1957) was a heist film written by Griffith expanded from a TV play, \"The Little Guy\", with musical acts inserted.He was meant to make Rock'n'Roll Girl for AIP in December 1957.In April 1957, Corman announced he would try to make two films back-to-back from then on to save costs.Corman made two \"teen girl noirs\", Teenage Doll (1957) for the Woolner Brothers and Sorority Girl (1957), starring Susan Cabot for AIP.For AIP, he made The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent (1957), shot in August 1957. He was meant to follow this with Teenage Jungle by Tony Miller.The success of Not of this Earth and Crab Monsters led to Allied offering Corman a four-picture deal for 1958.\n\nMachine Gun Kelly and producing\nCorman received his first serious critical praise for Machine-Gun Kelly (1958), an AIP biopic of the famous gangster, which gave Charles Bronson his first leading role and co-starred Cabot. Campbell wrote the script.\nAlso for AIP, he did Teenage Caveman (1958), with Robert Vaughn, originally titled Prehistoric World.\nHe helped produce two films for Allied Artists, both from scripts by Leo Gordon: Hot Car Girl (1958), directed by Bernard Kowalski and produced by his brother Gene (the first film they made together) from a script by Gordon; and The Cry Baby Killer (1958), which gave Jack Nicholson his first starring role.\nHe had his biggest budget yet for I Mobster (1958), a gangster story, co-produced by Edward L. Alperson and Corman's brother Gene for 20th Century Fox. In September 1958, he was reported as scouting locations in Australia to do a remake of H. Rider Haggard's She.War of the Satellites (1958) was conceived and shot in record time to take advantage of the Sputnik launch; it was his first collaboration with art director Daniel Haller.\nCorman also produced, but did not direct, Stakeout on Dope Street (1958), directed by Irvin Kershner, Night of the Blood Beast (1958), directed by Kowalski for AIP, using leftover costumes from Teenage Caveman, and Crime and Punishment U.S.A. (1959), directed by Dennis Sanders with George Hamilton in his first lead role.\n\nThe Filmgroup\nIn January 1959, Corman announced he would be moving into distribution.In 1959, Corman founded The Filmgroup with his brother Gene, a company producing or releasing low-budget black-and-white films as double features for drive-ins and action houses. In February 1959, Filmgroup announced they would release 10 films. Their first movies were High School Big Shot (1959) and T-Bird Gang (1959) produced by Stanley Bickman.\n\nFor AIP, Corman and Griffith made a black comedy, A Bucket of Blood (1959). Corman announced he would follow it with a similar comedy, The Bloodshot Private Eye. It does not seem to have been made. Instead, Griffith reused the same script structure and Corman employed many of the same cast in The Little Shop of Horrors (1960). This film was reputedly shot in two days and one night.For Filmgroup, Corman directed The Wasp Woman (1959), starring Cabot from a script by Gordon. His brother and he made two films back-to-back in South Dakota: Ski Troop Attack (1960), a war movie written by Griffith and directed by Corman, and Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), the first film directed by Monte Hellman.\nCorman went to Puerto Rico and produced another two films back-to-back: Battle of Blood Island (1960), directed by Joel Rapp, and Last Woman on Earth (1960), directed by Corman from a script by Robert Towne. Filming on these two films went so quickly that Corman commissioned Griffith to write a third, which was shot at the same time: Creature from the Haunted Sea (1961).\nCorman was going to make Part Time Mother from a script by Griffith but it appears to have never been made.\n\nHouse of Usher\nAIP wanted Corman to make two horror films for them, in black and white, at under $100,000 each on a 10-day shooting schedule. Corman, however, was tired of making films on this sort of budget and was worried the market for them was in decline. He proposed making a film in colour for $200,000, shot over 15 days. Corman proposed an adaptation of \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" by Edgar Allan Poe and AIP agreed. The film was announced in May 1959.Richard Matheson was hired to do the adaptation and Vincent Price was brought in to star; Haller did the art direction. The resulting film, House of Usher (1960), shot in early 1960, was a critical and commercial hit.\nFollowing this, Corman bought two scripts, Sob Sisters Don't Cry and Cop Killer. In March 1960, Corman announced that Filmgroup would be part of an international production group, Compass Productions. He directed a peplum in Greece, Atlas (1961) in August.\nHe was going to direct a thriller from a script by Robert Towne, I Flew a Spy Plane Over Russia. It was not made; neither were two comedies he was to make with Dick Miller and Jon Haze, Murder at the Convention and Pan and the Satyrs.House of Usher had been so successful that AIP wanted a follow-up, and Corman, Haller, Matheson and Price reunited on The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). It was another sizeable hit, and the \"Poe cycle\" of films was underway.\nCorman hired Charles Beaumont to write Masque of the Red Death and announced two films, Captain Nemo and the Floating City and House of Secrets.\n\nThe Intruder\nFollowing The Pit and the Pendulum, Corman directed one of William Shatner's earliest appearances in a lead role with The Intruder (a.k.a. The Stranger, 1962). Based on a novel by Charles Beaumont, the film was co-produced by Gene Corman and was shot in July and August 1961. It took a while for the film to be released and it lost money.Corman was unhappy with his profit participation on the first two Poe films, so he made a third adaptation for different producers, The Premature Burial (1962), written by Charles Beaumont and starring Ray Milland. The film was co-financed by Pathe labs; AIP put pressure on Pathe and ended up buying out their interest.\nFor producer Edward Small, Corman made a historical horror piece about Richard III, Tower of London (1962), starring Vincent Price.  It was meant to be the first in a three-picture deal with Small, but Corman did not enjoy working with the producer.\nFor Filmgroup, he also bought the rights to a Soviet science-fiction film, Nebo Zovyot (1959) and had some additional footage shot for it by his then-assistant, Francis Ford Coppola; the result was Battle Beyond the Sun (1962). He also released The Magic Voyage of Sinbad (1962), dubbed from a Soviet film.\nThe fourth Poe was an anthology, Tales of Terror (1962), shot in late 1961. One of the installments, \"The Black Cat\", was a comedy, inspiring Corman to do a whole Poe story comedically next: The Raven (1963). Later, Corman used the sets for that film for The Terror (1963), made for Filmgroup but released by AIP, and starring Boris Karloff (whose scenes were all shot in two days) and Jack Nicholson. Corman did not direct all of this film; additional scenes were shot by Monte Hellman, Coppola, and Jack Hill, among others.\nThe Young Racers (1963) was produced and directed by Corman in Europe for AIP, starring and written by Campbell. Working on the film was Francis Ford Coppola, whom Corman financed to make his directorial debut, Dementia 13 (1963).\nBack in the U.S., Corman made X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes (1963), a contemporary science-fiction film for AIP starring Ray Milland. He followed it with The Haunted Palace (1963), ostensibly part of the Poe cycle\u2014it featured Price and was made for AIP, written by Beaumont\u2014but was actually based on a story by H. P. Lovecraft.\nCorman directed a war film in Yugoslavia with his brother, The Secret Invasion (1964), with Stewart Granger and Mickey Rooney, from a script by Campbell. Following this, he announced he would make The Life of Robert E. Lee as part of a four-picture deal with Filmgroup worth $3.75 million. Other movies were Fun and Profit by Joel Rapp, The Wild Surfers by John Lamb, and Planet of Storms by Jack Hill. None of these films was made, nor was The Gold Bug, a Poe adaptation written by Griffith.\n\nEnd of the Poe cycle and filming in Europe\nCorman made two Poes in England starring Price, the much-delayed The Masque of the Red Death (1964), with Campbell rewriting Beaumont's scripts, and The Tomb of Ligeia (1965), from a script by Robert Towne. Corman made no further Poes; AIP started up a fresh Poe cycle in the late 1960s, but Corman was not part of it.\nCorman got Towne to write a script called The Red Baron. He bought the rights to another Soviet science-fiction film, Planeta Bur (1962), and had some additional footage added to it by Curtis Harrington. The result was Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet (1965). Harrington used footage from Planeta Bur in another film financed by Corman, Queen of Blood (1966).\nHe also bought the rights to a Yugoslavian film, Operation Titan (1963), and financed additional shooting by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman. The result was Blood Bath (1966). He also had an investment in the beach party films Beach Ball (1965) and It's a Bikini World (1967).\n\nWorking for major studios\nCorman said, \"For ten years as an independent I could get financing for $100-$200-$300,000 pictures. Everything had been interesting, artistically satisfying, economically satisfying. But I decided I was going nowhere and wanted to move directly into the business. So I accepted a contract with Columbia.\"In August 1965, Corman announced he had signed a contract with United Artists to make two films over three years. He also signed with Columbia to make a Western, The Long Ride Home, based on a script by Robert Towne.He was announced for a number of other projects at Columbia: the biopic of Robert E. Lee, an adaptation of Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, an adaptation of Kafka's The Penal Colony, and a script by novelist Richard Yates about the Battle of Iwo Jima. He intended to make The Deserters for UA, from a script by Wright, but that was not made either.He later reflected, \"Every idea I submitted was considered too strange, too weird; every idea they had seemed too ordinary to me. Ordinary pictures don't make money.\"\n\nThe Wild Angels\nAfter a year of not directing, Corman took a leave of absence under his contract with Columbia to make a film for AIP, the first biker movie, The Wild Angels. It starred Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra, from a script by Griffith; Peter Bogdanovich worked as Corman's assistant. The film opened the 1966 Venice Film Festival and was hugely successful at the box office, making over $6 million on a $350,000 budget and kicking off the \"biker movie\" cycle.He wanted to make a film about the Red Baron, but Columbia turned it down because of The Blue Max (1966). He proposed a movie about the St Valentine's Day Massacre and also an adaptation of the novel Only Lovers Left Alive. Nick Ray was meant to be making Only Lovers in Britain.\nCorman did begin directing Long Ride Home with Glenn Ford at Columbia. However, Corman left production a few weeks into the shoot in June 1966 and was replaced by Phil Karlson. The film was retitled A Time for Killing (1967).\nCorman received an offer to direct a studio film,The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (1967), for 20th Century Fox, starring Jason Robards and George Segal. He did not enjoy the restrictions of working for a major studio. He was given a $2.5 million budget and made it for $400,000 less. Corman, an independent director, was most comfortable in his own style:  shoestring budgets and shooting schedules measured in days, rather than weeks. Nonetheless, it is generally considered one of his best films as a director.\nCorman was meant to follow this with Robert E. Lee for United Artists at a budget of $4.5 million. It was not made. Neither was a story Corman optioned, The Spy in the Vatican.\n\nReturn to independence\nHe continued to finance films for Filmgroup: Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet (1965), dubbing a Soviet movie Planeta Bur into English with some additional footage shot by Curtis Harrington, Queen of Blood (1966), using some Soviet footage but a mostly new film, directed by Harrington, Blood Bath (1966), an adapted Yugoslavian film with additional footage shot by Stephanie Rothman and Jack Hill, and  Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women (1967), yet another dubbed version of Planeta Bur with some additional footage shot by Corman's then-assistant Peter Bogdanovich.\nHe had money in Navy vs. the Night Monsters (1967). He financed two Westerns shot back to back in Utah, directed by Monte Hellman and written and co-produced by Jack Nicholson, The Shooting (1967) and Ride in the Whirlwind (1967), which became cult successes. He also financed two films directed by Dan Haller, Devil's Angels (1967), a follow-up to Wild Angels written by Griffith, and a car racing film shot in Europe, The Wild Racers (1968). He announced a comedy about the population explosion, There Just Isn't Any Room, but it appears to have never been made.Corman directed The Trip for AIP, written by Jack Nicholson and starring Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Bruce Dern. This began the psychedelic film craze of the late 1960s and was the American entry at Cannes that year. AIP made some changes to the film in post-production, which made Corman unhappy.\nIn September 1967, he announced plans to build a new film studio. However, this did not happen for a number of years.\nCorman made a film for American TV, Target: Harry (1968), shot in Europe with his brother producing. He did some uncredited directing on AIP's De Sade (1969) when director Cy Endfield fell ill. He financed Bogdanovich's first feature, Targets (1968), which incorporated footage from The Terror. He also produced The Dunwich Horror (1970) for AIP, directed by Haller and co-written by Curtis Hanson, and financed Haller's Paddy.\n\nFinal films as director\nFor AIP, Corman returned to the director's chair for a gangster film, Bloody Mama (1970), starring Shelley Winters and a young Robert de Niro. It was a big hit at the box office. He also directed a black comedy, Gas-s-s-s (1970), written by George Armitage; it was cut without his permission by AIP and was a financial failure.United Artists finally agreed to finance his Red Baron project, although they asked that it emphasize American characters. Accordingly, it was filmed as Von Richthofen and Brown (1971), shot in Ireland in July 1970. There were several plane crashes during filming and one person died.Corman was going to make a film of Couples, a novel by John Updike for United Artists, and In from a script by Richard Schupe, but decided to take a break from directing.\n\"Directing is very hard and very painful,\" he said in 1971. \"Producing is easy. I can do it without really thinking about it.\"\n\nNew World Pictures\nIn May 1970, Corman founded New World Pictures, which became a small independently owned production/distribution studio, immediately successful with Angels Die Hard (1970), a biker film, and The Student Nurses (1971), directed by Rothman.  The Big Doll House (1971), directed by Jack Hill in the Philippines, was a big hit, making a star of Pam Grier. The company made a profit of $3.2 million in its first financial year, and Corman says all eleven out of his first eleven films were successful.  Angels Die Hard led to a series of biker films, including Angels Hard as They Come (1971), produced by Jonathan Demme with Jack Fisk working as art director. Bury Me an Angel (1971) was the first biker movie directed by a woman, Barbara Peeters. Corman financed the directorial debuts of Curtis Hanson, Sweet Kill (1971), produced by Corman protege Tamara Asseyev.  Student Nurses led to a \"cycle\" of nurse pictures, including Private Duty Nurses (the first film directed by George Armitage), Night Call Nurses (1972) (the first feature directed by Jonathan Kaplan), The Young Nurses and Candy Stripe Nurses (1975). There was also The Student Teachers (1973) and Summer School Teachers (1974).  Big Doll House was followed by a series of women in prison pictures, such as Women in Cages (1972), The Hot Box (1972), Black Mama, White Mama (1973), The Arena (1974) (the first film directed by Steve Carver) and Caged Heat (1974) (the first film directed by Demme).  Of New World's second year, Corman says 11 of the 12 releases were successful.  Corman produced one more film at AIP, Boxcar Bertha (1972), the second feature directed by Martin Scorsese, starring David Carradine. He also executive produced Unholy Rollers (1972) for AIP.  A proposed political satire, The Wild Political Prank, was not made.  He made I Escaped from Devil's Island (1973) with his brother and produced Cockfighter (1974) with Monte Hellman, which was a rare financial failure for New World.  A big hit was Big Bad Mama (1974), a gangster film directed by Carver and starring Angie Dickinson. It led to a follow-up, Crazy Mama (1975), produced by his wife and directed by Demme.  In 1975, Corman said New World was \"the most successful independent film company in the country...if you count AIP as a major\". He said they were \"the best of the cheap acts\".\n\nDistributing foreign films\nIn the 1970s the major Hollywood studios were moving away from distributing foreign arthouse pictures, New World moved into the market and became the U.S. distributor for Cries and Whispers (1972), directed by Ingmar Bergman. Corman bought it for $75,000 and it earned over $2 million at the U.S. box office. and Corman's distribution side of New World brought many foreign films to mass audiences in the U.S. for the first time - reportedly some played at drive-ins and grindhouses - including the works of Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut (The Story of Adele H., Small Change), Peter Weir (The Cars That Ate Paris), Federico Fellini (Amarcord), Joseph Losey (The Romantic Englishwoman), Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff (The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum, The Tin Drum) and Akira Kurosawa (Dersu Uzala). New World also released Fantastic Planet (1974).\nIn a 10-year period, New World Pictures won more Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film than all other studios combined.\n\n20th Century Fox\nHe had a four-picture deal with 20th Century Fox, making Capone (1975), Fighting Mad (1976) (directed by Demme), Moving Violation (1976) and Thunder and Lightning (1977).\n\nPeak of New World\nDeath Race 2000 (1975), written by Robert Thom and directed by Paul Bartel, was a big hit, earning $4 million. It helped inspire a series of car chase movies: Cannonball (1976), directed by Bartel; Eat My Dust! (1976), directed by Griffith starring Ron Howard, which led to a follow-up, Grand Theft Auto (1978), Howard's directorial debut. There was also The Great Texas Dynamite Chase (1976), Deathsport (1978) and Smokey Bites the Dust (1981).\nNew World's trailers were cut by Joe Dante and Alan Arkush. Corman gave them the chance to direct together, with Hollywood Boulevard (1976), which used outtakes from other New World films. It was successful enough for Corman to give both men jobs directing features on their own: Dante with Piranha (1978) and Arkush with Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979).\nPiranha was written by John Sayles, who had been discovered by Corman's story editor, Frances Doel. Sayles later wrote The Lady in Red (1979) for Corman, which was directed by Lewis Teague.\nOther popular films around this time included Tidal Wave (1975), a Japanese film to which Corman added some extra footage, and Jackson County Jail (1976). He also financed I Never Promised You a Rose Garden. Less popular was Avalanche (1979), a disaster film directed by Corey Allen.\nFor Universal he made Fast Charlie... the Moonbeam Rider (1979), directed by Carver. He financed Bogdanovich's Saint Jack (1979).\nCorman was criticized when he insisted on the addition of footage featuring a rape for Humanoids from the Deep (1980). Similarly, in Galaxy of Terror, as noted on Schlock and Awe...some, \"Corman promised the investors that the film would feature a Taaffe O'Connell sex-scene and a gruesome death-scene as-well. To save time, Corman put the two together. The actress agreed to a nude scene, but NOT a rape scene. Corman isn't the kind of man who takes no for an answer, and after some contract renegotiation, O'Connell agreed to being raped to death by a giant worm-monster. Money\u2026 it does amazing things.\"The success of Star Wars inspired New World's most expensive film yet, Battle Beyond the Stars (1981). This film required extensive special effects, prompting Corman to buy a movie studio in Main Street Venice for $1.5 million. Corman made a TV film for CBS, The Georgia Peaches (1980).\nBattle Beyond the Stars was so successful Corman had its footage and music score reused in other films such as Galaxy of Terror (1981) and Forbidden World (1982).\nHe picked up a film called The Personals (1983) which enjoyed success.\n\nMillennium Films\nCorman sold New World Pictures in January 1983 to a consortium of three lawyers for $16.9 million.Under the terms of the contract, he agreed to stay on as a consultant for two years and to provide New World with at least five films they could release. New World agreed to distribute all of Corman's films until March 1984. He set up a new production company, Millennium \u2013 the title of which was taken from the name of a 1981 retrospective of Corman's work at the National Film Theatre of London. He announced plans to make films budgeted between $2\u20135 million using cash from his sale of New World to finance personally. He announced an intention to make fewer commercial films, movies more like I Never Promised You a Rose Garden and Cries and Whispers.\nMillennium's films included Space Raiders (1983), a science fiction epic using footage and music from Battle Beyond the Stars; Love Letters (1984), a serious drama from Amy Holden Jones; Screwballs (1984), a sex comedy in the vein of Porky's; Suburbia (1984), directed by Penelope Spheeris, which he acquired, Deathstalker; and Kain of Dark Planet (which became The Warrior and the Sorceress).\n\nNew Horizons\nCorman says people struggled with the name \"Millennium\" \u2013 \"nobody could spell it, nobody knew what it meant\" \u2013 so he changed it to New Horizons by early 1984.Corman and the new owners of New World ended up suing each other in March 1985. Corman claimed that New World failed to honor their guarantee to distribute his movies at a fee of 15%. He sought $400 million in damages and the return of the company. He said they refused to distribute School Spirit (1985) and Wheels of Fire. He also claimed that New World cheated him distributing Space Raiders, Screwballs and Slumber Party Massacre. New World sued Corman in return, claiming he was seeking to return to distribution, and was discrediting New World to potential investors. They said Corman bypassed New World for some of his films, such as Columbia's Hardbodies (1984). Corman argued \"My whole point in selling was to free myself of the burden of running the company and to get guaranteed distribution. If I can't get my guaranteed distribution, I'm forced to go back to running the company.\"\n\nConcorde Pictures\nThe case with New World settled out of court. In March 1985 Corman announced he would establish a new distribution \"cooperative\", Concorde Pictures, where producers could get relatively cheap distribution from Concorde in exchange for contributing to the company's overhead. Their first releases were Corman productions School Spirit, Wheels of Fire and Barbarian Queen. Concorde later merged with a low budget production company, Cinema Group, and announced plans to make 15-20 films a year.Early Concorde releases include Loose Screws (1985), a sequel to Screwballs;  Streetwalkin' (1985), a more serious drama directed by Joan Freeman; Cocaine Wars (1986), the first in a series of movies Corman would finance in South America; Hour of the Assassin (1987), shot in Peru and the first film directed by Luis Llosa; and Munchies (1987), a spoof of Gremlins directed by Tina Hirsch.\nCorman also remade Not of this Earth (1988) and released Big Bad Mama II (1987), and Transylvania Twist (1989); all three were directed by Jim Wynorski. He produced another version of Masque of the Red Death (1989), directed by Larry Brand.\nHe produced Sweet Revenge (1987), Slumber Party Massacre II (1988), directed by Deborah Brock, Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure (1988), also directed by Brock, and The Terror Within (1989), directed by Thierry Notz.\nCorman financed the early directorial efforts of Carl Franklin (Nowhere to Run (1989)), Vargas Llosa and Katt Shea (Stripped to Kill (1988), Stripped to Kill II (1989)). More experimental was Nightfall (1988).\nAfter Hour of the Assassin, he made a series of films in Peru, including Crime Zone (1989), also directed by Luis Llosa, and Full Fathom Five (1990), directed by Carl Franklin.\nConcorde had a big hit with Bloodfist (1989), starring Don \"the Dragon\" Wilson which cost $1 million and earned over $6 million. Concorde signed Wilson to a long-term contract and he made a number of sequels for the company, including Bloodfist II and Fighting to Win.\n\nFrankenstein Unbound\nHe returned to directing once more with Frankenstein Unbound (1990).\n\nConcorde and New Horizon in the 1990s\nIn 1990, Concorde sued MGM for $6 million.Concorde's films included Overexposed (1990), The Unborn (1991), and In the Heat of Passion (1992). They had a big hit with Carnosaur (1993), which led to several sequels. He financed Fire on the Amazon (1991, directed Luis Llosa) which had Sandra Bullock and Craig Sheffer in early roles.\nCorman had to deal with the decline of the drive-in market and studio competition through the 1990s, but Concorde-New Horizons still made 15-24 pictures a year. This included a never-released version of The Fantastic Four.\n\nRoger Corman Presents\nIn 1995 Corman was executive producer on Roger Corman Presents, a special series of 13 movies for Showtime with budgets of around $1.5 million each. \"I think the Corman name means action, humor and some titillation,\" says Mike Elliott, the producer of the series. \"It's going to deliver the goods \u2013 and it will have a little moral statement in there as well.\" Corman ended up doing a second season of 11 movies. The films were Bram Stoker's Burial of the Rats, Hellfire, Virtual Seduction, Suspect Device, Unknown Origin, Terminal Virus, Where Evil Lies, Vampirella, Shadow of a Scream, Subliminal Seduction, House of the Damned (a.k.a. Spectre), The Haunted Sea, Alien Avengers (a.k.a. Aliens Among Us) and its sequel, Inhumanoid, Sawbones, Not Like Us, and Last Exit to Earth. He created his own comic book franchise, Black Scorpion, which led to a sequel and later a TV series. Corman also executive-produced remakes of The Wasp Woman, Humanoids from the Deep, A Bucket of Blood (a.k.a. The Death Artist), Piranha and Not of this Earth.\n\nIreland\nConcorde set up operations in Ireland as Concorde Anois, building studios in Connemara, County Galway. He received some support from the Irish government, a decision which became controversial when the content of some Corman productions such as Criminal Affairs was criticized in the press.Later Concorde-New Horizons films included Overdrive (1997). \"The genres still hold\", said Corman in 1997, \"action adventure, the suspense thriller, science fiction and horror. The difference is that they are bigger and better now. \"Corman also produced the film Moving Target which was filmed in County Galway. It was his last film produced with Concorde-New Horizons.\n\nRoger Corman's Cosmic Comics\nCorman operated a short-lived comic book imprint in 1995\u20131996 called Roger Corman's Cosmic Comics. It produced comics based on his films, written and drawn in a similar no-hold-barred style. Titles included Bram Stoker's Burial of the Rats, Caged Heat 3000, Death Race 2020, Welcome to The Little Shop of Horrors, and Rock & Roll High School \u2014 the latter featuring the Melvins (instead of the Ramones). Notable creators published by Cosmic Comics included Trevor Goring, James Kochalka, Jason Lutes, Pat Mills, Shane Oakley, Jerry Prosser, and J. R. Williams.

In 1921 he began in motion pictures as an actor and directed his first silent film in 1923. He went on to direct more than one hundred and eighty films. He worked frequently at the Poverty Row studio Chesterfield Pictures during the 1930s. The first full-length motion picture he directed for MGM was Last of the Pagans (1935) starring Ray Mala. \nAt MGM, he teamed up with producer Pandro S. Berman in the 1950s, with whom he made several films, including Ivanhoe (1952), The Prisoner of Zenda (1952), Knights of the Round Table (1953), All the Brothers Were Valiant (1953) and The Adventures of Quentin Durward (1955).\nAfter directing The Last Challenge in 1967, he retired from the film industry.\nHis two favorite films were Night Must Fall (1937) and Two Girls and a Sailor (1944).\n\nWizard of Oz\nThorpe is also known as the original director of The Wizard of Oz. He was fired after two weeks of shooting because it was felt that his scenes did not have the right air of fantasy about them. Thorpe notoriously gave Judy Garland a blonde wig and cutesy \"baby-doll\" makeup that made her look like a girl in her late teens rather than an innocent Kansas farm girl of about 13. Both makeup and wig were discarded at the suggestion of George Cukor, who was brought in temporarily. Stills from Thorpe's work on the film survive today. Further, it is understood that bits of his filmed footage of Toto escaping from the Wicked Witch's castle are featured in the film, albeit uncredited.\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Thorpe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd. In 2003 a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars in Palm Springs, California was dedicated to him and his son Jerry.He died in Palm Springs, California on May 1, 1991.\n\nSelected filmography\nAs director\nPassage 10:\nHassan Zee\nHassan \"Doctor\" Zee is a Pakistani-American film director who was born in Chakwal, Pakistan.\n\nEarly life\nDoctor Zee grew up in Chakwal, a small village in Punjab, Pakistan. as one of seven brothers and sisters  His father was in the military and this fact required the family to move often to different cities.

She was married to Frederick IV, Duke of Swabia, in 1166, and became a widow in 1167. In 1171 she was engaged and in February 1177 married to Canute of Denmark in Lund. The couple lived the first years in Sk\u00e5ne. On 12 May 1182, they became king and queen. She did not have any children. During her second marriage, she chose to live in chastity and celibacy with her husband. Arnold of L\u00fcbeck remarked of their marriage, that her spouse was: \"The most chaste one, living thus his days with his chaste spouse\" in eternal chastity.\nPassage 3:\nSophia Magdalena of Denmark\nSophia Magdalena of Denmark (Danish: Sophie Magdalene; Swedish: Sofia Magdalena; 3 July 1746 \u2013 21 August 1813) was Queen of Sweden from 1771 to 1792 as the wife of King Gustav III. \nBorn into the House of Oldenburg, the royal family of Denmark-Norway, Sophia Magdalena was the first daughter of King Frederick V of Denmark and Norway and his first consort, Princess Louise of Great Britain. Already at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, as part of an attempt to improve the traditionally tense relationship between the two Scandinavian realms. She was subsequently brought up to be the Queen of Sweden, and they married in 1766. In 1771, Sophia's husband ascended to the throne and became King of Sweden, making Sophia Queen of Sweden. Their coronation was on 29 May 1772.\nThe politically arranged marriage was unsuccessful. The desired political consequences for the mutual relations between the two countries did not materialize, and on a personal level the union also proved to be unhappy. Sophia Magdalena was of a quiet and serious nature, and found it difficult to adjust to her husband's pleasure seeking court. She dutifully performed her ceremonial duties but did not care for social life and was most comfortable in quiet surroundings with a few friends. However, she was liked by many in the Caps party, believing she was a symbol of virtue and religion. The relationship between the spouses improved somewhat in the years from 1775 to 1783, but subsequently deteriorated again.\nAfter her husband was assassinated in 1792, Sophia Magdalena withdrew from public life, and led a quiet life as dowager queen until her death in 1813.\n\nEarly life\nPrincess Sophie Magdalene was born on 3 July 1746 at her parents' residence Charlottenborg Palace, located at the large square, Kongens Nytorv, in central Copenhagen. She was the second child and first daughter of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark and his first consort, the former Princess Louise of Great Britain, and was named for her grandmother, Queen Sophie Magdalene. She received her own royal household at birth.\nJust one month after her birth, her grandfather King Christian VI died, and Princess Sophie Magdalene's father ascended the throne as King Frederick V. She was the heir presumptive to the throne of Denmark from the death of her elder brother in 1747 until the birth of her second brother in 1749, and retained her status as next in line to the Danish throne after her brother until her marriage. She was therefore often referred to as Crown Princess of Denmark.In the spring of 1751, at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, and she was brought up to be the Queen of Sweden. The marriage was arranged by the Riksdag of the Estates, not by the Swedish royal family. The marriage was arranged as a way of creating peace between Sweden and Denmark, which had a long history of war and which had strained relations following the election of an heir to the Swedish throne in 1743, where the Danish candidate had lost. The engagement was met with some worry from Queen Louise, who feared that her daughter would be mistreated by the Queen of Sweden, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. The match was known to be disliked by the Queen of Sweden, who was in constant conflict with the Parliament; and who was known in Denmark for her pride, dominant personality and hatred of anything Danish, which she demonstrated in her treatment of the Danish ambassadors in Stockholm.After the death of her mother early in her life, Sophia Magdalena was given a very strict and religious upbringing by her grandmother and her stepmother, who considered her father and brother to be morally degenerate. She is noted to have had good relationships with her siblings, her grandmother and her stepmother; her father, however, often frightened her when he came before her drunk, and was reportedly known to set his dogs upon her, causing in her a lifelong phobia.\nIn 1760, the betrothal was again brought up by Denmark, which regarded it as a matter of prestige. The negotiations were made between Denmark and the Swedish Queen, as King Adolf Frederick of Sweden was never considered to be of any more than purely formal importance. Louisa Ulrika favored a match between Gustav and her niece Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt instead, and claimed that she regarded the engagement to be void and forced upon her by Carl Gustaf Tessin. She negotiated with Catherine the Great and her brother Frederick the Great to create some political benefit for Denmark in exchange for a broken engagement. However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, who was very loved for her kindness and charity. This view was supported by the Caps political party, which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika. Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: \"His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen\". In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated.\nWhen a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: \"why Gustav, you seem to be already in love with her! She looks stupid\", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: \"She would suit you better!\"\n\nCrown Princess\nOn 1 October 1766, Sophia Magdalena was married to Gustav by proxy at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen with her brother Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark, as representative of her groom. She traveled in the royal golden sloop from Kronborg in Denmark over \u00d6resund to H\u00e4lsingborg in Sweden; when she was halfway, the Danish cannon salute ended, and the Swedish started to fire. In Helsingborg, she was welcomed by her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Hesse, who had crossed the sea shortly before her, the Danish envoy in Stockholm, Baron Schack, as well as Crown Prince Gustav himself. As she was about to set foot on ground, Gustav was afraid that she would fall, and he therefore reached her his hand with the words: \"Watch out, Madame!\", a reply which quickly became a topic of gossip at the Swedish court.\nThe couple then traveled by land toward Stockholm, being celebrated on the way. She met her father-in-law the King and her brothers-in-law at St\u00e4ket Manor on 27 October, and she continued to be well-treated and liked by them all during her life in Sweden. Thereafter, she met her mother-in-law the Queen and her sister-in-law at S\u00e4by Manor, and on the 28th, she was formally presented for the Swedish royal court at Drottningholm Palace. At this occasion, Countess Ebba Bonde noted that the impression about her was: \"By God, how beautiful she is!\", but that her appearance was affected by the fact that she had a: \"terrible fear of the Queen\". On 4 November 1766, she was officially welcomed to the capital of Stockholm, where she was married to Gustav in person in the Royal Chapel at Stockholm Royal Palace.Sophia Magdalena initially made a good impression upon the Swedish nobility with her beauty, elegance and skillful dance; but her shy, silent, and reserved nature soon made her a disappointment in the society life. Being of a reserved nature, she was considered cold and arrogant. Her mother-in-law Queen Louisa Ulrika, who once stated that she could comprehend nothing more humiliating than the position of a Queen Dowager, harassed her in many ways: a typical example was when she invited Gustav to her birthday celebrations, but asked him to make Sophia Magdalena excuse herself by pretending to be too ill to attend. Louisa Ulrika encouraged a distance between the couple in various ways, and Gustav largely ignored her so as not to make his mother jealous.\nSophia Magdalena was known to be popular with the Caps, who were supported by Denmark, while Louisa Ulrika and Gustav sided with the Hats. The Caps regarded Sophia Magdalena to be a symbol of virtue and religion in a degenerated royal court, and officially demonstrated their support. Sophia Magdalena was advised by the Danish ambassador not to involve herself in politics, and when the spies of Louisa Ulrika reported that Sophia Magdalena received letters from the Danish ambassador through her Danish entourage, the Queen regarded her to be a sympathizer of the Danish-supported Caps: she was isolated from any contact with the Danish embassy, and the Queen encouraged Gustav to force her to send her Danish servants home. This she did not do until 1770, and his demand contributed to their tense and distant relationship. In 1768, Charlotta Sparre tried to reconcile the couple at their summer residence Ekolsund Castle, but the marriage remained unconsummated.After King Adolf Frederick of Sweden died in 1771, Gustav III became King of Sweden. The following year, on 29 May, Sophia Magdalena was crowned Queen.\n\nEarly reign as Queen\nThe coronation of Gustav III and Sophia Magdalena took place on 29 May 1772. She was not informed about the coup of Gustav III, which reinstated absolute monarchy and ended the parliamentary rule of the Estates in the revolution of 1772. At the time she was deemed as suspicious and politically untrustworthy in the eyes of the King, primarily by her mother-in-law, who painted her as pro-Danish. Denmark was presumed to oppose the coup; there were also plans to conquer Norway from Denmark.\nSophia Magdalena was informed about politics nonetheless: she expressed herself pleased with the 1772 parliament because Count Fredrik Ribbing, for whom she had taken an interest, had regained his seat. The conflict between her and her mother-in-law was publicly known and disliked, and the sympathies were on her side. In the contemporary paper Dagligt Allehanda, a fable was presented about R\u00e4vinnan och Turturduvan (\"The She Fox and the Turtle Dove\"). The fable was about the innocent turtle dove (Sophia Magdalena) who was slandered by the wicked she fox (Louisa Ulrika), who was supported by the second she fox (Anna Maria Hj\u00e4rne) and the other foxes (the nobility). The fable was believed to have been sent from the Caps party.Queen Sophia Magdalena was of a shy and reserved character, and was never a member of the King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents. In 1777, for example, she dressed as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Usually it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award. She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the court around her outgoing spouse.As queen, she was expected to do a great deal of representation \u2013 more than what had been expected from previous queens due to her husband's adoration of representation. On formal occasions, she was at her best: she performed beautifully according to royal court etiquette, and was seen as dignified and impressive. For instance, on 17 September 1784, she cut the cord to let off the first air balloons from the Stockholm observatory. During the King's Italian journey in 1783\u201384, she hosted a grand formal public dinner every two weeks. During that time, she appeared at the Royal Swedish Opera and at the French Theater, but otherwise preferred her solitude. This attracted attention as during the absence of the King she had been expected to represent the royal couple all the more.\nSophia appeared to have enjoyed nature trips in the country side with only one lady-in-waiting and two footmen, however, her country side visitations were stopped because it was deemed 'unsuitable'. Several of her ladies-in-waiting were well known Swedish women of the era, among them The Three Graces: Augusta von Fersen, Ulla von H\u00f6pken and Lovisa Meijerfelt, as well as Marianne Ehrenstr\u00f6m and Charlotta Cedercreutz, who were known artists.\nSophia Magdalena was a popular Queen: on 22 July 1788, for example, during the absence of her spouse in Finland, several members of the Royal Dramatic Theater and the musical society Augustibr\u00f6der, among them Bellman, took a spontaneous trip by boat from the capital to Ulriksdal Palace, where she was, and performed a poem by Bellman to her honor at the occasion of her name day.\nIn the famous diary of her sister-in-law, Princess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte, Sophia Magdalena is described as beautiful, cold, silent and haughty, very polite and formal, reserved and unsociable. When she performed her duties as Queen, her sister-in-law, Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, described her as \"Forced to meet people\".Sophia Magdalena preferred to spend her days in solitude whenever she could. She had two very intimate friends, Maria Aurora Uggla and Baroness Virginia Charlotta Manderstr\u00f6m, but otherwise rarely participated in any social life outside of what was absolutely necessary to perform her representational  duties. She frequently visited the theater, and she also had a great interest for fashion. As a result of this, she was somewhat criticized for being too vain: even when she had no representational duties to dress up for and spend her days alone in her rooms, she is said to have changed costumes several times daily, and according her chamberlain Adolf Ludvig Hamilton, she never passed a mirror without studying herself in it. She was also interested in literature, and educated herself in various subjects: her library contained works about geography, genealogy and history. She educated herself in Swedish, English, German and Italian, and regularly read French magazines. According to Augusta von Fersen, Sophia Magdalena was quite educated, but she was not perceived as such because she rarely engaged in conversation.In 1784, after the King had returned from his trip to Italy and France, the relationship between the King and Queen soured. At this time, Gustav III spent more and more time with male favorites. In 1786, this came to an open conflict. The King had taken to spend more time at intimate evenings with his favorite Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, from which he excluded her company. When he gave some of her rooms at the Royal Palace to Armfelt, Sophia Magdalena refused to participate in any representation until the rooms were given back to her, and she also banned her ladies-in-waiting from accepting his invitations without her permission.\nIn 1787, she threatened him with asking for the support of the parliament against him if he took their son with him to Finland, which she opposed, and the year after, she successfully prevented him from doing so. She also reprimanded him from allowing his male favorites to slander her before him.\nQueen Sophia Magdalena was never involved in politics, except for one on one occasion. In August 1788, during the Russo-Swedish War (1788\u20131790), the King gave her the task to enter in negotiations with Denmark to prevent a declaration of war from Denmark during the ongoing war against Russia. He asked her to call upon the Danish ambassador Reventlow and give him a letter to be read in the Danish royal council before her brother, the Danish King. He gave her the freedom to write as she wished, but to use the argument that she spoke as a sister and mother to a son with the right to the Danish throne and upon her own initiative.\nSophia Magdalena called upon the Danish ambassador, held a speech to him followed by a long conversation and then handed him a letter written as a \"warm appeal\" to her brother. A copy was sent to Gustav III, and her letter was read in the royal Danish council, where it reportedly made a good impression. However, her mission was still unsuccessful, as the Russo-Danish alliance made it unavoidable for Denmark to declare war shortly afterward. At the time, there was a note that she met two Russian prisoners of war in the park of the Haga Palace, and gave them 100 kronor each.\n\nAt the parliament of 1789 Gustav III united the other estates against the nobility and to gain support for the war and for his constitutional reform. Coming into conflict with the nobility, he had many of its representatives imprisoned. This act led to a social boycott of the monarch by the female members of the aristocracy, who followed the example of Jeanna von Lantingshausen as well as the King's sister and sister-in-law, Sophie Albertine of Sweden and Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte. The Queen did not participate in this political demonstration and refused to allow any talk of politics in her presence. She was nevertheless involved in the conflict. When the King informed his son about the event, he discovered the child to be already informed in other ways than what he had intended. He suspected Sophia Magdalena to be responsible, and asked the governor of the prince, Count Nils Gyldenstolpe, to speak to her. Gyldenstolpe, however, sent one of the king's favorites, Baron Erik Boye. The Queen, who despised the favorites of the King, furiously told Boye that she spoke to her son how she wished and that only her contempt for him prevented her from having him thrown out of the window. She was known to dislike the reforms of 1789, and she did let it be known to its representatives. At the celebrations of the Victory at Fredrikshamn in 1790, she refused to be escorted by riksr\u00e5d Count Joakim Beck-Friis, who was in favor of the reform, and demanded to be escorted by Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, who was in opposition to it.\nIn the autumn of 1790, the King chose to remain in the summer residence of Drottningholm Palace well in to the autumn because of the social boycott. Finally, the Queen returned to the capital without his consent. He accused her of having been manipulated by the female courtiers into participating in the political demonstration, and refusing him the company of her ladies-in-waiting by leaving. This applied especially to Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie and Augusta von Fersen, who did not participate in the boycott: he suspected Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen to have persuaded the Queen to participate in the boycott. This is however is not considered to have been true: though the Queen did oppose to the act of 1789, she is reported never to have allowed any one to speak of politics in her presence. The reason to why she wished to leave was reportedly due to her health, as Drottningholm was quite cold by that time of the year and she had been afflicted by an ear infection. The King did in any case suspect her of being in political opposition to him, and before his trip to Aachen in 1791, he ordered that his son was to be separated from her during his absence abroad. When she was made aware of this, Sophia Magdalena caused a public scene when she visited him in his box at the opera and demanded to be given access to her son. This led to a heated argument and she left the box with the words: \"I will have my vengeance, monsieur! I give you my sacred vow on that!\"\n\nSuccession issues\nSophia Magdalena is mostly known in Swedish history for the scandal created around the consummation of her marriage and the questioned legitimacy of her son. Her marriage was a then normal arranged royal match for political convenience, in which Sophia Magdalena at first was described by her spouse as \"cold as ice\". Sophia Magdalena's religious upbringing and introverted character made her avoid the lively and spontaneous Gustavian court life, which made her even less attractive in the eyes of her outgoing spouse.Their marriage was not consummated until 1775, nine years after the wedding. The status quo between Gustav III and his consort was nurtured by the Queen Dowager, Louisa Ulrika, who did not want competition in her influence over her son. There were rumors that the King was a homosexual or sexually underdeveloped. His sexuality, which had much effect on Sophia Magdalena's life, as a royal marriage was designed to produce offspring, has been much debated. His sexual inexperience has been blamed on immaturity or him also being asexual.\nAs a teenager, Gustav had a crush on Axel von Fersen's mother, Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie, though this affection was never physical. In 1768, he had another infatuation with the noble Charlotte Du Rietz, but this is not believed to have been sexually consummated either. Various documents written during his lifetime alleged that he was bisexual or homosexual.\nHis sister-in-law, Princess Charlotte, claims that the King did participate in homosexual activity after his trip to Italy in 1784 and that there were several rumors about this: she claims that she herself had witnessed that the park at Drottningholm Palace had become a place where male courtiers searched for homosexual partners, and in a letter to Sophie von Fersen, she writes in code: \n\n\"It is said that the King recently attacked a young man in the park at night and offered him the post of chamberlain to the Queen if he agreed to his lusts, but the young man preferred to leave. Agree that this is to take things too far. It is said that the trips to Svartsj\u00f6 Palace are made to be provide privacy, it is unbelievable, but it is what it is said. I could tell you a million things about this.\"\nIn 1791, Sophia Magdalena herself paid a surprise visit to the King during his stay at the Gustav III's Pavilion, where the King had spent more time since he came in conflict with the nobility after the 1789 parliament; and where he was reputed to indulge in orgies. She found the King in bed, and he asked one of his favorites, Count Fabian Wrede, to show her around. In the King's private chamber, however, the Queen found the actor and page of the King, Lars Hjortsberg, sleeping, naked. The Queen reacted by interrupting the tour by saying to Wrede that he apparently did not know his way around Haga, as he had obviously showed her the chamber of the staff rather than the King by mistake.Some sources explain that both the Queen and the King had serious anatomical problems resulting in erotic complications. Erik L\u00f6nnroth has concluded that there is no factual proof for the rumors that Gustav III was inclined toward homosexuality or bisexuality, nor that Gustav Adolf was illegitimate.\nDuring the Coup of Gustav III on 19 August 1772, Sophia Magdalena was at Ekolsund Castle. After having been told of the successful coup where her consort had reinstated absolute monarchy, she confided to her Mistress of the Robes, Countess Anna Maria Hj\u00e4rne, that she was afraid that she would now be divorced by Gustav, because she knew she was not liked by him, because she had not given birth, and because she knew she was being slandered before him. Gustav III was told of this and her words led to a conflict. At a following ball at Ekolsund, the King told Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, that he did plan to divorce her on the grounds of pro-Danish plots and adultery with riksr\u00e5d Count Fredrik Sparre and Marcus Gerhard Rosencrone of the Danish legation in Stockholm. Von Fersen, however, convinced him not to by saying that she should not be regarded to participate in pro-Danish plots just for her love of her Danish chamber-maids, and that as a neglected wife, she should not be blamed for enjoying the compliments of Count Ribbing, which were not grounds for suspicions of adultery. During this period, it had been noted that Count Ribbing was often seen in the company of the Queen and had paid her compliments and made her laugh, among other things by caricaturing her Mistress of the Robes Countess Anna Maria Hj\u00e4rne. Countess Hj\u00e4rne had informed the King that the Queen was pregnant, \"And the riksr\u00e5d Ribbing is her favorite.\"The King had given Countess Ulrica Catharina Stromberg the task to investigate this, and she was told by the chamber madame of Sophia Magdalena, Charlotta Hellman, that: \"information, which where dubious, especially since the clearest evidence could be gathered from the linen of the Queen\". Her contact with Rosencrone is said to have been restricted to the fact that he handled her correspondence with Denmark. After the reconciliation of Sophia Magdalena and Gustav III, he apologized to her for having believed these rumors.\nIn 1774, the King arranged the marriage between his brother, the future Charles XIII of Sweden, and Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, to solve, for the time being, the immediate question of an heir to the throne. The Duchess had false pregnancies and miscarriages only, which may have hastened the King to expedite the consummation of his own marriage and produce a son of his own.\nIn 1778, Sophia Magdalena gave birth to Gustav Adolf, successor to the throne, and in 1782, she gave birth to a second son, Charles Gustav, who only lived for one year. It was suggested in some circles that King Gustav's first son was sired by someone else. When the heir was born, the father was believed, by the Queen Dowager among others, to be Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila, then Riksstallm\u00e4stare. This rumor was believed by elements of the public and the royal court, and her acquiescence to it led to a year-long break between the Queen Dowager and her son.\n\nSuccession scandal\nThe King, claiming to be sexually inexperienced, called upon Munck to help him with a reconciliation with his spouse, instruct the couple in the ways of sexual intercourse, and physically show them how to consummate their marriage. Munck, a Finnish nobleman and, at the time, a stable master was, at that point, the lover of Anna Sofia Ramstr\u00f6m, the Queen's chamber maid. Through Anna Sofia Ramstr\u00f6m, Munck contacted Ingrid Maria Wenner, who was assigned to inform the queen of the king's wish, because she was married and the confidant of the queen. Munck and Ramstr\u00f6m were to be present in a room close to the bedchamber, ready to be of assistance when needed, and he was, at some points, called into the bedchamber. Munck himself writes in his written account, which is preserved at the National Archives of Sweden, that to succeed, he was obliged to touch them both physically.When it became known that Munck participated in the reconciliation between the royal couple, there were rumours that he was the father of Sophia Magdalena's firstborn.These became the subject of accusations from the political opposition, as late as in 1786 and 1789,:\u200a132\u200a where it was claimed that the whole nation was aware of the rumour that the King had asked Munck to make the Queen pregnant.:\u200a118\u200a Pamphlets to that end were posted on street corners all over Stockholm.:\u200a143\u200aThis was also caricatured by Carl August Ehrensv\u00e4rd in private letters discovered later \u2013 his drawing was published in 1987 \u2014, where he passed on a number of rumors and jokes about Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena and Munck without inferring that he believed they were true. There was also a rumour that the King and Queen had divorced in secret and that the Queen had married Munck.There is no proof that Munck was the father of the crown prince. Erik L\u00f6nnroth has suggested that the anatomical problems mentioned in Munck's account, known only to a few initiated persons, were the primary factor in their delay in producing an heir. At the time, the rumors became more persistent, however, when the royal couple presented Munck with gifts: the King promoted him, and the Queen gave Munck a pension, a diamond ring, and a watch with her image.A few socialites took the Queen Mother's side in supporting and spreading the rumors, such as Anna Charlotta Schr\u00f6derheim and Eva Helena L\u00f6wen.The circle around the King's brother, Duke Charles, the future Charles XIII of Sweden, who desired the throne, also encouraged these rumors. Their mother was quoted as saying, during the pregnancy of Sophia Magdalena, that there were rumors among the public that the future child was illegitimate, and that she herself believed that the King had hired Munck to impregnate the Queen, and that she would never accept that the throne would come into the hands of \"a common nobleman's illegitimate offspring\".:\u200a103\u20134\u200aThe Queen Mother ordered Duke Charles to interrogate Munck, and word spread to the King, who was shocked. Sophia Magdalena was equally shocked by the accusations. She swore she would never speak to the Queen Dowager again, and indeed she never did.\nThe King arranged for his mother to make a public apology for her accusation in the presence of the rest of the Royal Family the 12 May 1778. The scene gained a lot of attention and broke the bonds between Gustav III and his mother. The scandal disturbed celebrations, as did an accident with the public banquet. The public was invited to a great feast to celebrate the birth of the heir, but too many people were let in, and the crowd panicked. Between sixty and one hundred people were trampled to death in the crowd.\nSven Anders Hedin, a medical doctor at the royal court, and married to one of the Queen's chambermaids, Charlotta Hellman, contributed two statements which have been quoted in connection with the scandal. In the summer of 1780, during the King's absence abroad, he passed through the private apartments of the Queen, which were expected to be empty at that hour. There, he claimed to have seen the Queen and Baron Munck embracing each other through the not-quite closed door to her bedroom.  To warn them that they were not alone, he hummed a tune and pretended to speak to himself, saying that he would be in trouble if the Queen discovered him there, and then left the room. He claimed to have found three expensive court costumes in his room a few days after this event. In October 1781, Hedin met the King in the corridor on his way to the Queen's bedchamber. Gustav III asked Hedin what time it was, and Hedin claims to have added to his reply: \"In nine months, I will be able to answer exactly!\" in which Hedin insinuated that the King had expected him to remember the time should the fatherhood of the next child be questioned.\nIn 1782, Sophia Magdalena had a second son. After the death of her younger son in 1783, her marriage deteriorated. In May 1784, Sophia Magdalena is believed to have had a miscarriage, and after this, there are no further notes of any pregnancies. A brief reconciliation in 1787 was deemed by Duchess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte in her diaries as temporary, with no hope of being complete and lasting,:\u200a191\u200a as the King was not \"receptive to female charm\": another insinuation that he was homosexual.\nIn 1787, Sophia Magdalena deposited a sum of 50.000 riksdaler in an account for Munck, which was generally rumoured to be a \"farewell gift\".:\u200a156\u20137\u200a  At this point, Munck had started an affair with the ballerina Giovanna Bassi, to whom Sophia Magdalena showed great dislike.:\u200a157\u200a  The King was terrified when he heard that the Queen had made that deposit, and he tried to prevent the transaction from becoming public knowledge, which, however, did not succeed.:\u200a157\u200a Munck was, however, continued to be used as a go-between and a messenger between the King and the Queen, especially during conflicts.\nA child of Giovanna Bassi's, rumored to be the child of Munck, bore a strong likeness to the Crown Prince.\n\nQueen Dowager\nOn 16 March 1792 Gustav III was attacked and mortally wounded. Sophia Magdalena was reportedly shocked and horrified by the attack. The conspirators intended to make her the regent of her son during his minority.:\u200a443\u200a As a Guardian government had been necessary by putting a minor monarch on the throne, their plan was to offer this role to Sophia Magdalena by taking military control and offering the Queen dowager the role of presiding over the guardian council instead of her brother-in-law Duke Charles. Directly after she was told of the attack, Sophia Magdalena sent for the king's favorite, Gustav Mauritz Armfelt, and was taken by him to the sick bed of the King. There, she took the hands of the King between hers and cried out to Armfelt: \"How horrifying! Such a cruel atrocity!\" She was kept informed of his state by Armfelt, but she was prevented from further visits because Gustav did not wish to receive visits from women because of the smell from his wounds. At the death of Gustav III 29 March 1792, she attempted to visit him, but she was blocked by her brother-in-law Duke Charles, who fell on his knees before her to stop her from entering the bed room.\nSophia Magdalena caused a scandal as it was noted that she did not dress in mourning except when she was forced to do so at visits and on formal occasions.:\u200a442\u200a  This criticism was likely worsened because she was exposed to some suspicions, as it was known that the conspirators had planned to make her regent.\nAs Queen Dowager, it was a relief to Sophia Magdalena to withdraw from public life. Her brother-in-law, Duke Charles, became regent, and she eschewed a political role. As a widow, Sophia Magdalena lived a withdrawn life. She did not wish to take part in any representational duties, and she gave up her quarters at Drottningholm Palace to be relieved of them. She lived in the Royal Palace in Stockholm during the winter, and at Ulriksdal Palace during the summer. She lived in a circle of her own court, and seldom entertained any guests other than her lifelong friends Maria Aurora Uggla and Virginia Manderstr\u00f6m. It is noted that, although she had hated the male favorites of her spouse during his lifetime, she gave several of them positions in her court as a widow. Sophia Magdalena had a close relationship with her son, King Gustav IV Adolf, who visited her regularly and with whom she shared an interest in religion.\n\nIn 1797, she insisted on skipping the protocol at the reception of her daughter-in-law, Frederica of Baden. The etiquette demanded that as Queen Dowager, she should not greet her daughter-in-law at the stair of the royal palace with the rest of the royal family, but wait for her in her own salon, but she refused: \"I know myself how I suffered, when I arrived to Sweden, and how painfully I reacted to the cold reception I was given by Queen Louisa Ulrika. As for my daughter-in-law, I have decided to spare her from having to experience such bitter emotions!\" During the reign of her son, she seldom showed herself at court except on Sundays and at court presentations, and preferred to stay at her estate. She regularly met her son and his family on family visits, but she did not participate in court life.\nIn 1809 she witnessed the coup and following abdication of her son, King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, after Sweden lost Finland to Russia. She was deeply affected by his deposition. On the day of the coup, she was informed by her friend Maria Aurora Uggla, and in her company she immediately rushed to the quarters of her son. She was prevented from seeing him by guards, and burst into tears in the arms of Uggla. Shortly after, she was visited in her quarters by Duke Charles in the company of guards, who officially told her what had happened and made her burst into tears again by officially banning her from seeing her son. When she, during the captivity of her son, formally applied for permission to see him, and was told by Charles that she could not unless given permission by the government, she publicly commented: \"The government was not asked for permission for the murder of my husband, neither any permission was sought to depose and imprison my son, but I must have their permission, to speak to my child.\" She was never to see her son again, but she corresponded with him for the rest of her life. He was sent into exile and replaced by his paternal uncle Charles XIII, but she remained in Sweden until her death. She did, however, say goodbye to her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren when they left Stockholm to join Gustav Adolf.\nIn January 1810, she was presented to the elected heir to the throne, Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden. During his visit, he stopped before the portrait of her grandson Gustav, and informed her that he wished to adopt him for his successor. Later that year (2 November 1810), she was presented to the next elected heir to the throne, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte. He regarded her with suspicion and believed that she did not wish to see him, but she commented: \"I am grateful for the sensitivity of the Crown prince, but he is mistaken, if he believes that I do not wish to see him! It would be unfair if I were to hold the least bit of dislike toward him, for it is not he who has deposed my son!\" At the meeting, her face was said to have turned white, but at the end, she is said to have been delighted by his charm. In 1811, she was one of the few in the Swedish Court who were nice to D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary.\nIn September 1812, Germaine de Sta\u00ebl was presented to her, and gave her the impression of her: \"Her Majesty analyzed my books as an educated woman, whose judgement showed as much thoroughness as well as delicate feeling. Never has any one impressed me such as your Queen! I almost dared not reply to her, so taken was I by the royal glory around her \u2013 it gave me such respect, that I shivered!\" When the Crown Prince banned any contact between Swedes and the former royal family, Germaine de Sta\u00ebl asked that an exception was to be made for Sophia Magdalena, and it was: her letters were however read by foreign minister Lars von Engestr\u00f6m.\n\nLater life and death\nSophia Magdalena lived more isolated towards the end of her life and was affected by worsened health. From 1812, she devoted much of her time to her friendship with the young amateur botanic Baron Anton Fredrik Wrangel. She never fully recovered after having suffered a stroke in May 1813.\n\nChildren\nIn popular culture\nThe affair of the consummation of her marriage and the succession scandal was portrayed in SVT's period drama production of \"Gustav III:s \u00e4ktenskap\" (The Marriage of Gustav III) in 2001, where Sophia Magdalena was portrayed by Danish actress Iben Hjejle.\nIt was also used to inspire the novel Drottningens juvelsmycke, famous in Sweden, where the character of Tintomara is portrayed as a half sibling of Gustav IV Adolf through Count Munck.\n\nAncestry\nInline references\nBibliographic references\nAlm, Mikael (2003\u20132006).

She is particularly interested in Andy, whose father, also a detective, was murdered in the line of duty.\nThings are complicated further with Agent Brown's investigation into Andy and his crew. Brown tells Andy that he has an informant who is leaking out the details, and Andy, disbelieving at first, begins to resign himself to the fact that one of his men is betraying him.\nAfter Captain Friendly is assassinated by a local gangster named Chamorro, Andy, Stan, Pepe, and Barney decide to take the law into their own hands and go after Chamorro. While interrogating Chamorro, they find out that Brown has been supplying the drug dealer with information about the police raids, to help his own investigation.

Henri Christophe was a slave purchased by her father. Supposedly, he earned enough money in tips from his duties at the hotel that he was able to purchase his freedom before the Haitian Revolution. They married in Cap-Ha\u00eftien in 1793, having had a relationship with him from the year prior. They had four children: Fran\u00e7ois Ferdinand (born 1794), Fran\u00e7oise-Am\u00e9thyste (d. 1831), Ath\u00e9na\u00efs (d. 1839) and Victor-Henri.\nAt her spouse's new position in 1798, she moved to the Sans-Souci Palace. During the French invasion, she and her children lived underground until 1803.\n\nQueen\nIn 1811, Marie-Louise was given the title of queen upon the creation of the Kingdom of Haiti. Her new status gave her ceremonial tasks to perform, ladies-in-waiting, a secretary and her own court. She took her position seriously, and stated that the title \"given to her by the nation\" also gave her responsibilities and duties to perform. She served as the hostess of the ceremonial royal court life performed at the Sans-Souci Palace. She did not involve herself in the affairs of state. She was given the position of Regent should her son succeed her spouse while still being a minor.  However, as her son became of age before the death of his father, this was never to materialize.After the death of the king in 1820, she remained with her daughters Am\u00e9thyste and Ath\u00e9na\u00efs at the palace until they were escorted from it by his followers together with his corpse; after their departure, the palace was attacked and plundered. Marie-Louise and her daughters were given the property Lambert outside Cap. She was visited by president Jean Pierre Boyer, who offered her his protection; he denied the spurs of gold she gave him, stating that he was the leader of poor people. They were allowed to settle in Port-au-Prince. Marie-Louise was described as calm and resigned, but her daughters, especially Ath\u00e9na\u00efs, were described as vengeful.\n\nExile\nThe Queen was in exile for 30 years. In August 1821, the former queen left Haiti with her daughters under the protection of the British admiral Sir Home Popham, and travelled to London. There were rumours that she was searching for the money, three million, deposited by her spouse in Europe. Whatever the case, she did live the rest of her life without economic difficulties. The English climate and pollution during the Industrial Revolution was determintal to Am\u00e9thyste's health, and eventually they decided to leave.In 1824, Marie-Louise and her daughters moved in Pisa in Italy, where they lived for the rest of their lives, Am\u00e9thyste dying shortly after their arrival and Ath\u00e9na\u00efs in 1839. They lived discreetly for the most part, but were occasionally bothered by fortune hunters and throne claimers who wanted their fortune. Shortly before her death, she wrote to Haiti for permission to return. She never did, however, before she died in Italy. She is buried in the church of San Donnino. A historical marker was installed in front of the church on April 23, 2023 to commemorate the Queen, her daughter and her sister.\n\nSee also\nMarie-Claire Heureuse F\u00e9licit\u00e9\nAd\u00e9lina L\u00e9v\u00eaque\nPassage 6:\nPrincess Auguste of Bavaria (1875\u20131964)\nPrincess Auguste of Bavaria (German: Auguste Maria Luise Prinzessin von Bayern; 28 April 1875 \u2013 25 June 1964) was a member of the Bavarian Royal House of Wittelsbach and the spouse of Archduke Joseph August of Austria.\n\nBirth and family\nAuguste was born in Munich, Bavaria, the second child of Prince Leopold of Bavaria and his wife, Archduchess Gisela of Austria.

She is also the granddaughter of Agust\u00edn Batista y Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza, who was the founder of the Trust Company of Cuba, the most powerful Cuban bank prior to the Cuban Revolution.In October 1959, at the time of the Cuban Revolution, Maria Teresa Mestre\u2019s parents left Cuba with their children, because the new government headed by Fidel Castro confiscated their properties. The family settled in New York City,  where as a young girl she was a pupil at Marymount School. From 1961 she carried on her studies at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de New York. In her childhood, Maria Teresa Mestre took ballet and singing courses. She practices skiing, ice-skating and water sports. She later lived in Santander, Spain, and in Geneva, Switzerland, where she became a Swiss citizen.In 1980, Maria Teresa graduated from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva with a degree in political sciences. While studying there, she met her future husband Henri of Luxembourg.\n\nSocial and humanitarian interests\nSoon after her marriage, Maria Teresa and the then Hereditary Grand Duke Henri established The Prince Henri and Princess Maria Teresa Foundation to help those with special needs integrate fully into society. In 2001, she and her husband created The Grand Duke and Grand Duchess Foundation, launched upon the accession of the couple as the new Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg. In 2004, the Grand Duke Henri and the Grand Duchess Maria Teresa Foundation was created after the merging of the two previous foundations.\nIn 1997, Maria Teresa was made a special ambassador for UNESCO, working to expand education for young girls and women and help to fight poverty.Since 2005, Maria Teresa has been the chairwoman of the international jury of the European Microfinance Award, which annually awards holders of microfinance and inclusive finance initiatives in developing countries. Also, since 2006, Maria Teresa has been honorary president of the LuxFLAG (Luxembourg Fund Labeling Agency), the first agency to label responsible microfinance investment funds around the world.On 19 April 2007, the Grand Duchess was appointed UNICEF Eminent Advocate for Children, in which role she has visited Brazil (2007), China (2008), and Burundi (2009).She is a member of the Honorary Board of the International Paralympic Committee and a patron of the Ligue Luxembourgeoise de Pr\u00e9vention et d\u2019Action medico-sociales and SOS Villages d\u2019Enfants Monde. The Grand Duchess and her husband Grand Duke Henri are the members of the Mentor Foundation (London), created under the patronage of the World Health Organization. She is also the president of the Luxembourg Red Cross and the Cancer Foundation. In 2016, she organized the first international forum on learning disabilities in Luxembourg.The Grand Duchess supports the UNESCO \u201cBreaking the Poverty Cycle of Women\u201d project in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. The purpose of this project is to improve the living conditions of girls, women and their families. As honorary president of her own foundation, Grand Duchess Maria Teresa set up a project called Projet de la Main Tendue after visiting the Bujumbura prison in 2009 in Burundi. The purpose of this project is to liberate minor people from prison and to give them new opportunities for their future.\nIn October 2016, Maria Teresa accepted an invitation to join the eminent international Council of Patrons of the Asian University for Women (AUW) in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The university, which is the product of east-west foundational partnerships (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Open Society Foundation, IKEA Foundation, etc.) and regional cooperation, serves extraordinarily talented women from 15 countries across Asia and the Middle East.In 2019, Maria Teresa presented her initiative \"Stand Speak Rise Up!\" to end sexual violence in fragile environments, launched in cooperation with the Women\u2019s Forum and with the support of the Luxembourg government. The conference is in partnership with the Dr. Denis Mukwege Foundation and We Are Not Weapons of War.In 2020 the Prime Minister of Luxembourg commissioned a report into the Cour le Grand Ducal following concerns over its working. The report found that up to 1/3 of employees had left since 2015 and that \"The most important decisions in the field of personnel management, whether at the level of recruitment, assignment to the various departments or even at the dismissal level are taken by HRH the Grand Duchess.\u201d Several newspaper reports at the time highlighted a 'culture of fear' around the Grand Duchess and \"that no-one bar the Prime Minister dared confront her\". The report also raised concerns about the use of public funds to pay for the Grand Duchess' personal website and that this had been prioritised over the Cour's own official website. There were also allegations that staff at the Court has been subject to physical abuse and these reports were investigated by the Luxembourg judicial police.\nIn February 2023 it was reported by several Luxembourg based media that the Grand Duchess had once again been accused of treating staff poorly during an outfit fitting in October 22. The incident even involved the Prime Minister of Luxembourg having to speak to the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess about the treatment of the staff and commissioning a report into it.\n\nFamily\nMaria Teresa married Prince Henri of Luxembourg in a civil ceremony on 4 February 1981 and a religious ceremony on 14 February 1981, since Valentine's Day was their favourite holiday. The consent of the Grand Duke had been previously given on 7 November 1980. She received a bouquet of red roses and a sugarcane as a wedding gift from Cuban leader, Fidel Castro. The couple has five children: Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, Prince F\u00e9lix of Luxembourg, Prince Louis of Luxembourg, Princess Alexandra of Luxembourg, and Prince S\u00e9bastien of Luxembourg, They were born at Maternity Hospital in Luxembourg City.\n\nHonours\nNational\nLuxembourg:\n Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau\n Grand Cross of the Order of Adolphe of Nassau\n\nForeign\nAustria: Grand Star  of the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria\n Belgium: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold I\n Brazil: Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross\n Denmark: Knight of the Order of the Elephant\n Finland: Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland\n France: Grand Cross of the Order of National Merit\n Greece: Grand Cross of the Order of Beneficence\n Italy: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic\n Japan: Grand Cordon (Paulownia) of the Order of the Precious Crown\n Latvia: Commander Grand Cross of the Order of the Three Stars\n Netherlands:\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion\nGrand Cross of the Order of the Crown\n Norway: Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Olav\nPortugal-\n Portuguese Royal Family:\nDame Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Saint Isabel\n Portugal:\nGrand Cross of the Order of Christ\nGrand Cross of the Order of Saint James of the Sword\nGrand Cross of the Order of Infante Henry\nGrand Cross of the Order of Cam\u00f5es\n Romania: Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania\n Spain: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III\n Sweden:\nMember of the Royal Order of the Seraphim\nCommander Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Polar Star\nRecipient of the 50th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n Media related to Maria Teresa, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website\nThe Mentor Foundation charity website\nPassage 10:\nHeather D.

She was the spouse of Euclid Tsakalotos, former Greek Minister of Finance.\n\nAcademic career\nBefore assuming her duties at the Bank of Greece and alternating child-rearing duties with her husband, Gibson worked at the University of Kent, where she published two volumes on international exchange rate mechanisms and wrote numerous articles on this and other topics, sometimes in cooperation with her husband, who was teaching at Kent at the time.\n\nPersonal life\nGibson first came to Greece in 1993, with her husband, with whom she took turns away from their respective economic studies to raise their three children while the other worked.The couple maintain two homes in Kifisia, along with an office in Athens and a vacation home in Preveza. In 2013, this proved detrimental to Tsakalotos and his party when his critics began calling him \u00ab\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\u00bb (aristeros aristokratis, \"aristocrat of the left\"), while newspapers opposed to the Syriza party seized on his property holdings as a chance to accuse the couple of hypocrisy for enjoying a generous lifestyle in private while criticizing the \"ethic of austerity\" in public. One opposition newspaper published on the front page criticism reasoning that Tsakalotos own family wealth came from the same sort of investments in companies as made by financial institutions JP Morgan and BlackRock.\n\nWorks\nEditor\nEconomic Bulletin, Bank of Greece\n\nBooks\nThe Eurocurrency Markets, Domestic Financial Policy and International Instability (London, etc., Longman: 1989) ISBN 0312028261\nInternational Finance: Exchange Rates and Financial Flows in the International Financial System (London, etc., Longman: 1996) ISBN 0582218136\nEconomic Transformation, Democratization and Integration into the European Union (London: Palgrave Macmillan: 2001) ISBN 9780333801222\n\nArticles and papers\n\"Fundamentally Wrong: Market Pricing of Sovereigns and the Greek Financial Crisis,\" Journal of Macroeconomics, Elsevier, vol. 39(PB), pp. 405\u2013419 (with Stephen G. & Tavlas, George S., 2014)\n\"Capital flows and speculative attacks in prospective EU member states\" (with Euclid Tsakalotos, Economics of Transition Volume 12, Issue 3, pages 559\u2013586, September 2004)\n\"A Unifying Framework for Analysing Offsetting Capital Flows and Sterilisation: Germany and the ERM\" (with Sophocles Brissimis & Euclid Tsakalotos, International Journal of Finance & Economics, 2002, vol. 7, issue 1, pp. 63\u201378)\n\"Internal vs External Financing of Acquisitions: Do Managers Squander Retained Profits\" (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, Studies in Economics, 1996; Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 2000)\n\"Are Aggregate Consumption Relationships Similar Across the European Union\" (with Alan Carruth & Euclid Tsakalotos, Regional Studies, Volume 33, Issue 1, 1999)\nTakeover Risk and the Market for Corporate Control: The Experience of British Firms in the 1970s and 1980 (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, 1998) PDF\n\"The Impact of Acquisitions on Company Performance: Evidence from a Large Panel of UK Firms\" (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, Oxford Economic Papers New Series, Vol. 49, No. 3 (Jul., 1997), pp. 344\u2013361)\n\"Short-Termism and Underinvestment: The Influence of Financial Systems\" (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, The Manchester School of Economic & Social Studies, 1995, vol. 63, issue 4, pp. 351\u201367)\n\"Testing a Flow Model of Capital Flight in Five European Countries\" (with Euclid Tsakalotos, The Manchester School of Economic and Social Studies, Volume 61, Issue 2, pp. 144\u2013166, June 1993)\nFull list of articles by Heather D Gibson. researchgate.net.
