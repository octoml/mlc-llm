But as he delves deeper into the mysteries of his past, he realizes that the stakes are higher than he ever could have imagined and that the fate of the entire kingdom rests on his shoulders.\n--------------------------\nWhy is magic forbidden?\n--------------------------\nThere are a few potential reasons why magic might be forbidden in the kingdom of Arvandor:\n\nFear: Magic can be a powerful and unpredictable force, and those who don't understand it may fear its potential consequences. The ruling authorities may ban magic in an attempt to exert control and prevent its misuse.\n\nOppression: The ruling authorities may also forbid magic as a way to oppress and control certain groups of people. For example, if magic users are a minority in the kingdom, the ruling authorities may see magic as a threat and seek to stamp it out.\n\nPrejudice: There may be cultural or societal prejudice against magic users in the kingdom, leading to discrimination and persecution.\n\nConvenience: The ruling authorities may see magic as a threat to their own power and control, and therefore forbid it in order to maintain the status quo.\n\nUltimately, the specific reason for magic being forbidden in the kingdom of Arvandor would depend on the motivations and goals of the ruling authorities and the societal and cultural context of the setting.\n--------------------------\nChoose option 2.\n--------------------------\nIn the kingdom of Arvandor, magic has been forbidden for centuries by the ruling authorities as a way to oppress and control certain groups of people. Those who possess magic are hunted by the tyrannical King Aldred and his army of knights, and any found to be using magic are punished severely.\n\nAs a result, magic users have been driven underground, forced to hide their abilities and live in secrecy. Many have been killed or imprisoned, and the fear of magic has become deeply ingrained in the society of Arvandor.\n\nHowever, a small group of rebels is determined to overthrow the oppressive monarchy and restore magic to the land. Led by a wise old wizard, the rebels seek to bring about a new era of freedom and equality for all magical beings. They believe that magic is a natural and powerful force that should be celebrated, not feared and suppressed.\n\nAt the heart of the rebellion is seventeen-year-old Thorne, an orphan who discovers he has the rare ability to wield magic. As Thorne trains to harness the full extent of his powers and rallies support for the rebellion, he must also confront the dark secrets of his past and the true nature of his identity. Can he overcome the forces arrayed against him and bring about a new future for Arvandor?\n--------------------------\nHow did Thorne's magical abilities manifest, and how did the king's forces find out about them?\n--------------------------\nThorne's magical abilities first manifested when he was a young child, although he was unaware of them at the time. As he grew older, he began to notice that strange things seemed to happen around him when he was upset or angry. For example, objects might move or break without him touching them, or he might accidentally set things on fire with a stray thought.\n\nAt first, Thorne tried to hide these abilities, fearing that he would be ostracized or punished if anyone found out. However, it became increasingly difficult to control his powers, and eventually, they were discovered by the king's forces.\n\nThere are a few ways this discovery could have happened:\n\nSomeone witnessed Thorne using magic and reported him to the authorities.\n\nThorne accidentally used magic in a public place, drawing attention to himself.\n\nThorne was targeted by the authorities because of his family history or because he was suspected of having magical abilities.\n\nRegardless of how it happened, once Thorne's abilities were discovered, he was forced to go on the run and seek refuge with the rebellion in order to escape the king's forces and the punishment that awaited him.\n--------------------------\nChoose Option 3.\n--------------------------\nIn the kingdom of Arvandor, Thorne's magical abilities were discovered by the king's forces because he was targeted due to his family history.\n\nThorne, an orphan, had always been unaware of his true parentage. However, the ruling authorities had long suspected that he was the illegitimate son of the late king, and they had been keeping a close eye on him in secret.\n\nWhen Thorne's powers began to manifest, the authorities saw it as confirmation of their suspicions and moved to apprehend him. Thorne was forced to go on the run and seek refuge with the rebellion in order to escape the king's forces and the punishment that awaited him.\n\nAs Thorne trains to harness the full extent of his powers and rallies support for the rebellion, he also begins to uncover the shocking truth about his past and his true identity. He realizes that he is the rightful heir to the throne of Arvandor, and that the fate of the entire kingdom rests on his shoulders.\n\nBut Thorne faces many challenges and dangers as he confronts the tyrannical King Aldred and seeks to claim his rightful place as ruler of Arvandor.

In this case, Thorne could have been orphaned as a result of the persecution of magic users.\n\nUltimately, the specific circumstances of Thorne's orphanhood would depend on the motivations and goals of the ruling authorities and the societal and cultural context of the setting.\n--------------------------\nChoose option 3.\n--------------------------\nIn the kingdom of Arvandor, Thorne was orphaned as a result of the political climate and the persecution of magic users.\n\nThorne's parents were both magic users, and they were targeted by the ruling authorities for their abilities.

He seeks refuge with the rebellion and begins to uncover the shocking truth about his past and his true identity as the illegitimate son of the late king and the rightful heir to the throne.\n\nAs Thorne trains to harness the full extent of his powers and rallies support for the rebellion, he must also confront the dangers and challenges that stand in his way as he fights for the future he believes in.\n--------------------------\nMake Thorne's mother a magic user and his father the noble late king who was assassinated by the current tyrannical king.\n--------------------------\nIn the kingdom of Arvandor, Thorne's mother was a magic user and his father was the noble late king who was assassinated by the current tyrannical king, Aldred.\n\nThorne's mother was forced to go into hiding and live in secrecy with her newborn son in order to avoid persecution by the ruling authorities.

You said maybe today I'll do better and turn my camera on. But feeling like ships. Sorry.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 00:29\nNo, that's quite our ice. And don't worry about it.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 00:32\nAre you starting to improve it all? Or is it kind of hanging around.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 00:37\nSo the minute I stock a few battle. You know. My kids, then get it. And then they give it back to me. And then we're just kind of. Reinfecting each other quite conveniently. Here. Recovering for a bit and then getting. Sick again. So it's been a bit weird because here, like we spoke the last time. Stephen is getting warmer.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:07\nAnd then we have a bit of sandstones that comes in from Saudi.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 01:11\nAnd normally when those samsungs come and everyone's going down. With. Virals in Dubai. So that's the situation hereby.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:21\nYeah. Okay. And the dance trials, they can just come out of nowhere, can't they.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 01:26\nOut of nowhere take over the entire city. Reduce visibility people with asthma Dust allergies. They just get so unwell normal people as well, because it comes to the acs. So even if we're in those and we think we're safe because it's like the fine dust it comes through the AC, the AC ventilation, and then.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:50\nYeah? There's no escape? No escape.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 01:54\nHopefully you start to get on the mend.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:56\nAnd soon enough I know it's. I don't. Have kids myself. I know, Kurt. You do. But from what I hear is, yeah, it can be quite cyclical. And these illnesses, they can just keep going around.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 02:11\nAbsolutely. So but. It's it's good. I mean, there's good to have company in misery. So it's okay. Lizzy, I can relate.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 02:26\nNo, no, I can relate. It seems like seems like we've had something in our house since November. So just. I have three little kids. They're four, eight and nine. And so. One of them will get it passed to one of the parents, and then just it just goes around like you said. But I'm really hoping 2023 is a year where we have like one week without anyone being sick.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 02:55\nSharing is caring.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 02:56\nMy kids are way older. My kids are 18. My daughter turned 18. Two weeks ago. And my son is 16. But it never changes. It's always the same scenario. Sharing is caring, and then they start blaming each other. Typical sibling site. Well, they're more social at that age, too.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 03:20\nSo it's easy to keep my fouryearold daughter at home if she's sick. But, you know, understand. I remember being 18, and it was a harder to keep me up in the house.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 03:29\nAbsolutely. Yeah. That's my situation right now. So we think we're getting better. And then two days later, we're down with this And it's really bad Cox and fevers and body aches. So it's a nasty, nasty viral that has definitely evolved into a superbug. That's what the doctors are seeing in Dubai as well. There was a news article yesterday that said the influenza. Bug has evolved into a superbug. So. Yep, it's fun. We're having a party hand by.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 04:01\nExciting times.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 04:06\nI was super excited after the last meeting. I love what Carry has to offer. Was even sharing that with Nathan. I love the analytics, I love the AI. Element to it as well. I love your dashboards. So exciting. So really looking forward to today as well.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 04:26\nOkay. Awesome. I'm glad to hear I didn't do a terrible job then. First some context. Curse is one of our solution engineers here as well. Lizzy. So. We can with curtain when Natan comes on as well, we can jump in or we can hold on for another couple of minutes. That's totally up to you, but we can start diving into some of the detail in specifically around. The consumption piece. I know that's an element to the business, but we can keep it pretty fluid as well. And if there's anything top of mind that you want to cover. Yeah. Do field questions, Curtis. Certainly the brains behind the operation here. So. You're well supported.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 05:12\nWhat I didn't see the last time, but I'm sure it's on clarity is like a Kp. dashboard. You know, apart from the Salesforce. That's. Then it's fantastic. There's also the Kpi dashboards that is currently. Managed manually. You know, in excel and with formulas. And then, of course, we recently converted those to Power Bi. But. Does clarity have. A version also that showcases. Like a scope of a comparative performance. Chart showing. Kpis. Kpi. Performance. Between each sales rep and then rolled up to the sales leader. There's something like that. On Clari.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 06:05\nSo. We can I suppose the short answer is yes, but requires a caveat that we would just need to understand specifically what it is that you're referring to. I think one thing that would be really helpful as well. At some point we can get a mutual mda in places, but just to get some visibility over the kpis that you're tracking and how you're visualizing that in excel. And in Power bi and we can see if it's that we can put together in a dashboard. I'm not sure karate have there's any additional context that you would kind of add there.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 06:38\nI think you nailed it. I mean, it's just about understanding what kpis are tracked. And there's probably several different ways we can support that. And Clari. The forecast module comes to mind where because you mentioned roll up. Right. So it's just understanding what formulas that you're using today, in which metrics that you're interested in tracking and then. Most of our customers, what they do is they'll have. Steven, I'm sure you let them know that in clarity you're not limited to one view of the forecast. So let's just say you have your sales global sales forecast in clarity. You could have a separate Kpi dashboard or Kpi based roll up where it's less about. Okay, well, what's the commit and upside, right?\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 07:24\nIt's more about here's the here of the sales reps and the frontline manager.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 07:28\nAnd maybe we're tracking asp's sales cycle link thing like things like that and rolling that.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 07:36\nYou all of that. Yep. That's exactly what I'm talking about.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 07:39\nCool. I need to. Hey, guys.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 07:42\nHey, Stephen. Hey, cut. Sorry I got tied up on a on another call, which is actually about this. Let's get.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 07:51\nNo worries at all have you been. Yeah.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 07:53\nVery good. Thanks. Very good. How about yourself? Yeah. Keep them.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 07:56\nWell, thank you. Keep them well. I just thought I'd mention as well. I'm not sure if you saw the email came through, but I put together just an intro for yourself and Johnny from compliance. He just shared his calendar there. They've been a customer for a few years. By the way, similar stack to you. They use kaia and Outreach for top of funnel as well. They do.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 08:20\nInteresting. They they do use kaya.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 08:22\nYeah. I think they use Outreach for tapa funnel. And for kaya, they might even use it for more. But I think that's it and then Clarity for kind of forecasting, pipeline management, things like that. But Johnny is very familiar with the Clarity platform, so definitely a good person to speak to.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 08:38\nSure. Yeah. I'll try and connect with him this week. I saw you share this calendar there, so hopefully get a chance to sync up.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 08:44\nOkay. Cool. Well, if you need my help at all, just let me know. And yeah, outside of that and me curse and curse one of our solution engineers here. So as I was saying to Lizzie, there definitely the brains behind the operation between the two of us. So be good to kind of dive into some of the more. Yeah tactical and detail stuff around the forecasting especially consumption today.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:06\nAbsolutely nice to meet you. Hi, Nathan. Nice to meet you as well.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 09:11\nHow you doing. Yeah. Doing great, man. Doing great.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:15\nExcited. Use case here around your Usage product. Based in Philadelphia. I've been with Clari for about three years and typically focus on Enterprise forecasting, deployments. So we have had a couple customers come through with the consumption use case. And so Stephen tapped me to consult on what you guys are doing, so hopefully we can help you out with Larry.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 09:41\nTrust. So look, I suppose by way of an agenda for the call today, we've got another 35 minutes set aside and thought it'd best just to kind of keep this pretty conversational. I mean, we can potentially jump in and show you elements of clarity as well, if needs be. I suppose the most important thing is that we get a full understanding for how you're currently. I suppose. Forecasting and measuring, but also then hosting data around that consumption piece as well so that we can kind of go away and put together a couple of different options and see if we can find a solution that's going to work for you on that. So yeah, I suppose maybe over to you initially to just give a little bit of an overview. Maybe. Nathan, Lizzie around how you're currently reporting. On that consumption at the moment. And I'm sure Kurt will have a few questions as we go. Or unless Krista was something that you wanted to kind of kick off with.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 10:32\nNothing to present, but if we could start at a high level and just understand the gotomarket approach for that product. And then how you're reporting and forecasting on that that would be very helpful.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 10:47\nYeah, no problem. I'll have a swing at them. So the product in question is called Martrus. So it's. A Payments business. You can see it more as like a fintech play. Not too dissimilar to like revolute or Monzo or you know, some of these kind of popular. He kind of more ewlowerdriven solutions that you see nowadays. So the go to market approaches like our vertical. Across all of our products is within shipping. So when we talk about that, it's like. Transportation Companies that move product by see. On Large tanker, bulk vessels. Right. And so the Martros product is aimed at the seafarers, because that's where the volume is in terms of.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 11:40\nPersonnel.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 11:42\nSo here's what selling to a shipping company. Who are responsible for those seafarers onboard vessels. And really the. Kind of three main products that we would try and sell into a shipping company. One is. The Crew Payment solution. So.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:02\nEvery time you pay your seatbearer, which typically once a month.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:07\nAnd even any of your employees. But more typically, the seafarers is where the value proposition makes sense. We would basically charge you $12 flat on that transaction. Right. Because those seeds bearers are typically getting paid in local currency. So that's a once a month transaction. And then. And this is where it gets a little bit complex. So that's quite predictable. That's a beta B type cell, right. Every Cfare is going to get paid every month.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:40\nPretty.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:41\nThere's then a B to B to C element because of our E wallet solution, which is once you paid those cf errors, they can also take advantage of our E wallet solution. And that helps them send money back home to their families. Right. So if the Cfarer decides to take that up. Then we typically see another $1212. Plus a small amount of fx revenue. So you could say $15 on when they paid or when they make another bank to bank transfer, which is typically like one or two. It's normally one to family back home. Right. And then you have card usage, which is like point of sale atma type transactions on that card. But that's going to be like really small fx revenue, which is tiny.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 13:34\nBut.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 13:36\nIt does make up part of the like the revenue portfolio for ewallet, but again really difficult to forecast people use for it but just want to kind of paint the picture and then the other the other. Part the mantra solution is kind of like whilst we're talking to you, we could also handle your vendor payment. So when you pay vendors. It'll be a same same platform. Ultimately, what are we doing? We're making payments faster with fewer transaction fees. With a much better compliance platform kind of wrapped around it. And again, we're going to find around $15 there per transaction when they pay their customers. So the vendor payments is quite predictable. If the customer give us their volume. We know the fee that we're going to get per, you know, bank to make transfer.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:24\nThe crew payments is quite predictable.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:27\nI just need to know how many crew you got and just confirm you pay them once a month. Is really tricky because that's that B to be to C element. Like, how many times are they gonna send money back home per month. How many times are they going to do atm withdrawals? They're buy a packet cigarettes. So they're gonna go and buy like a new car. Like.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:53\nJust really difficult.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:54\nAnd obviously we're making a few dollars on the fx as well every time they spend. And so, yeah, it's high. The average base that's highly, like. The challenge, as well as the ramp. So if you told me you've got 100 C fairs. Making. One payment, a month. $12 a month. That's quite easy for me to figure out what annually you're worth. Whatever. Right. But on the e wallet side. I don't know when your sea bearer is gonna choose to use it because they don't have to use it. No one can force them to use it if they don't want to. So like if you guys said, hey, we've got this amazing deal with revolution. If you use that card, you get all of these amazing perks. You might say I'm gonna stay with, like, Citibank. I'm not gonna use that. And so you're one less person that they have predicted that's just kind of dropped off, if that makes sense. But you never truly know when they're gonna drop off because there's no light optout or I want to say no. It's just like working with the accounts trying drive the doctrine. So as that ramp piece as well, which is which is which is tricky because we might say in accounts worth 100 grand and we sign them and we only find that within twelve months we found like 30 grand because we didn't get the adoption of the evolve.\"", "First I will provide you with some of my writing, take note of the style as well of the context.\n\nPlease use this space to describe how these events have impacted you.\n\nMy family was already struggling to meet our monthly expenses. It didn't help that my dad had to close down his retail stores in the city due to the pandemic. We created two new companies that year. Due to our financial situation, my family had decided to move to Texas from New York; this would be our fifth home since I was born. We understood what this called for, but packing and unpacking are still highly time-consuming, taking away from the limited time we had.\n\nMy side business of buying and selling sought-after sneakers using automation software was also taking off at the time, so I would manage that simultaneously. I did my best to focus in class, but I admit I often worked or packed while I should've been paying attention in class.\n\nMoving came with a whole new school where I couldn't choose my classes because I was enrolled late and wasn't even able to meet with my counselor due to covid restrictions. I juggled online classes and started new businesses back up with my dad. Covid-19 entirely shifted the way we lived from our environment and stress levels to our friends, or the lack thereof.\n\n--\n\nAdditional Info\n\nMany times during the last two years, I've sacrificed my focus on education to prioritize family. I've never concentrated less on school than in 2021, my junior year and a time when I was supposed to be applying for college. \n\nMy mother was expecting my baby brother. My grandparents had just come to live with us. My elder sister was in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy as she had been diagnosed with lymphoma in March of 2021. My dad had been searching for work and found a restaurant space he would start leasing the same month of my sister's diagnosis. As the old saying goes, when it rains, it pours. \n\nMy typical day would consist of taking online classes while replying to customers of my e-commerce business and designing content or adjusting the website for my dad's restaurant. During the lunch break, I would pack orders, prepare them to ship out, and then have my actual lunch during my next class. After classes ended around 4:30, I'd go to the hospital to check up on my sister before rushing back home to get ready to work at the restaurant until eleven at night. My grandfather, who has Parkinson's and suffers from dementia, routinely forgets where he is and runs out of the house. Since my mom could not run after him, every few days, we'd have to come back early and try to find him walking through an empty street at night. \n\nObviously, this schedule left no time for studying and sometimes not even for homework. I remember staying up until 1 or 2 am after getting back to finish AP US History assignments. Since it was so impossible to retain information in class, I'd decided not to take the SAT and even skip one of three of my AP tests. I worked late nights the entire month of May, and the one day I missed work because I had an AP test in the morning was a disaster at the restaurant. \n\nSince I was little, I've been a straight A's, school-first student. Unfortunately, it became challenging to keep up with this mindset, but I'm happy that I learned through the obstacles and, as a result, became a more rigid and more well-rounded individual. \n\n--\n\nSMU Application:\nSMU appeals to students for a variety of reasons. Briefly describe why you are interested in attending SMU and what specific factors have led you to apply. (250-word limit)\\*\n\nSMU defines my intersection of interests and morals. \n \nOne aspect that stands out is that the Cox School of Business teachers have real-world experience in the industry. An opportunity to pick their brains and bounce ideas off my professors would greatly benefit me; experience stands as the best teacher. The University also puts an emphasis on diversity and pledges that \"Every Mustang Will Be Valued.\" Playing into that, the SMU Muslim Student Association has made efforts in raising charity for local refugees, something I can easily contribute to, given my background in the field. \n \nIt's also easy to start a new student organization not already present on campus. One of my first goals would be to create a blockchain club to explore the future of the Web3 movement with my peers. The Mustangs have also partnered with the NFTU program, showing the University is open to blockchain technology. A growth environment is\n\nMy sister, who attends Boston College, recommends finding a school with a college culture I'll remember. With SMU, I get the best of both worlds, a distinct, social culture while staying close to home. Recently, I met a professor at SMU at a community service event I took part in. She encouraged me to apply and check out the campus. When I visited, there was a college football game that night, and I got to see the enthusiasm in the community\u2014a sense of livelihood I have missed since moving from New York. \nSMU is a diverse learning environment shaped by the convergence of ideas and cultures. How will your unique experiences or background enhance the University, and how will you benefit from this community? (250-word limit)\\*\nI bring my passions, culture, and experiences to SMU. Sharing my journey with those around me and hearing theirs. Engaging in deep conversations about culture, religion, and ethics is nothing new to me and serves as an example to learn from. \n \nThe best way to gain wisdom is from people and the environment. Being a Pakistani who comes from a background valuing family above all, I've gotten the chance to learn from the extraordinary journeys of the many who've made the voyage to America. These are my favorite stories to hear, some came to the country with little money, and even less formal education yet were successful in their endeavors through hard work and determination. \n \nAn advantage I think about frequently is the exposure to various personalities as a teenager in the city of New York. Absorbing diverse concepts and ideals serves as a leg up on the majority that hasn't. Our backgrounds mold us into who we are. Moving five houses in less than 15 years doesn't sound ideal, but it made me who I am today, and looking back, I'm thankful for the situation it has put me in. \n \nI aim to continue discovering new personalities at SMU. There are numerous stories of people finding a founding team for their business by networking at their University. I'm hoping to accomplish the same, surrounding myself with people who can teach me concepts I'm unfamiliar with and vice-versa. Ideas build on each other, and that's how we change the world.\n--\nDMHP: Write a letter to your future self:\n\nHello Zuhair,\n\nI'm writing this letter in 2022, just a day before our 18th birthday. Just two days ago, I attended Converge22 in San Francisco with Spawn, and I'm now trying to catch up on all the work I missed while I was away. My current stresses will probably seem minor to you now, but I need to figure out how to do my Calculus homework by tomorrow, and my group for the Comets to the Core presentation didn't even start on our slides yet.\n\nIn my list of long-term goals, I have two specific ones that I'm currently working on. The first is to start working out regularly, and the second is to learn how to code. For the last two weeks, I have been waking up around 6:30 to go to the gym, and my days have been feeling a lot more productive. At Converge, many people I met recommended I pick up a coding language as a technical skill to back up my design expertise and my interest in technology. I'm trying to learn javascript, and hopefully, by the time you're reading this, I'm familiar with multiple programming languages. I think it would be a huge unlock for me to add to my knowledge and build upon, mainly because I've been experimenting with programs since a young age.\n\nYou have a lot on your hands right now, namely, doing marketing for Spawn and now the UTD Investments Club. E-commerce is also doing reasonably well, but, especially in the holiday season, I just don't have enough hours in the day to concentrate on everything at total capacity. This week I've had to be on so many zoom calls while we put in proposals for sponsorships at Spawn.\n\nAnyway, I hope all is well. Whatever you do, take care of your health and spend time with family.\n\nWishing you the best - Zuhair, 2022\nTell us about a community or group to which you belong. How have you contributed to this group, and how has it benefitted you?\n\nI owe a lot of my accomplishments to my community, without which I wouldn't merely be the person I am today. Back in New York, my family played a significant role in MANA (Memon Association of North America); this group of Memons --a minority Muslim ethnic group originating from Indian and Pakistani heritage. MANA aimed to remind community members of their South Asian roots and keep a close-knit group of familiar faces.\n\nFor my parents, when they first moved, these were the only people they interacted with outside of work. In a place like New York, it's easy to get lost in fast-paced city life and forget where you come from. Memons are known for being merchants back in South Asia, so naturally, many community members also used the gatherings to network and help each other with the business and find partners for their children. \n\nEveryone starts somewhere, and for graphic design, MANA was looking for someone to design a flyer for a sports event. My dad told me I should do it, but I had no idea where to begin. I used web-based software and would screenshot the result. Looking back now, using several different fonts and colors is not as artistic as it seemed back then, but every time I look back, I see progress. \n\nMANA got me started with graphic design, and I still use the skills I first learned today; I went from picking random website templates to making my own using Adobe Illustrator and now Figma. Just this week, I am wrapping up two freelance projects for restaurants that hired me to design their logo, menu, and promotional content, and it all started by volunteering to make a cricket event graphic. My interest in design has even brought me to web design and app design, I've started experimenting with UI, and I trust I'll make the journey just like I did with flyer design. \n\nI continue to make flyers for MANA even after moving to Dallas. I owe them everything I've achieved in the design space and even business-wise. I've met my best friends by going to the event and still talk to them over discord, we're all similar in our business-mindedness, and there's no doubt the community helped shape that.\n--\nWhether it is graphic design, business ideas, or even thinking up games to play with my cousins, I have always found ways to incorporate my concepts to improve what I'm doing. I have been writing theories in a book since I was 12 years old, including developing electric cars and blockchain technology to stop corrupt government practices. Sometimes I will take breaks just to imagine the future of our existence, our roadblocks, and our objectives for a better life. In doing so, I idealize business paths for my future that solve said problems using technology. Automation has also been a focal point for me as I am interested in problem-solving and keep an open mind to upcoming innovations.\n\nI started in graphic design in 2016, and it has taken a significant portion of my time over the years. I visualize my ideas through digital work and incorporate my business sense to market products. I've learned Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom, Final Cut Pro X, and Figma, all for this purpose. Today I have designed branding language for several successful companies and continue to use digital media to my strength. My campaigns tend to go outside of the box, resulting in higher click rates due to the creative nature of the advertisements.\n\n\nThey say, \"Curiosity killed the cat,\" but most don't know the end of the idiom: \"and satisfaction brought it back.\" Satisfaction eluding to the reward that one feels once they finally find the answer they were looking for. My curiosity works similarly, sometimes not allowing me to finish my work until I have found what I am searching for, even if it may seem irrelevant at the time. I often fight with myself for needing to know how everything works; However, the pleasure it brings once I figure it out has me outweighing the cost with the benefits. \n\nThe aspect of curiosity plays into my perfectionist persona. Everything must be top-notch, or I am left with the guilt of knowing I could have done better given a bit more time down the eternal rabbit hole. The price of curiosity does not come without its compensation, though; I believe if there is interest in a subject long enough, one will eventually become a beneficiary after investing their time and/or knowledge into a concept. \n\nMy curiosity ranges a broad spectrum with a passion for blockchain technology, efficient marketing strategy, and human psychology, to name a few. Given a chance, I will always investigate and ask questions about a field or idea that piques my interest, and once I start, there is no end in sight. Therefore the \"satisfaction\" is produced when I reach a milestone in the long journey.\n\nSelf-motivation is a concept most struggle with, though I think this is the most effective type of motive. This determination has brought itself to light in my life in various ways. Tying into the endless curiosity point, my character does not rest until I believe I have achieved the highest quality given my resources. There is always somewhere I can improve. No matter how hard I've worked, if the next day was not better than the last, then I am still failing. \n\nWhile I know it is impossible to reach perfection, this does not stop me from trying. I have an infinite amount of problems to solve and concepts to learn with less time every day, so I know if I stop pushing boundaries, they will push me.\n\nResiliency has played a factor in my school life where an 'A' could always become an 'A+,' and my presentations would take hours because the design and transitions had to be flawless. In business, I set goals for myself at 15 years old, much higher than I expected, only to hit them in a few months. A big part of that comes from the nature of my family; we've seen ups and downs, making us immune to the worst of times and cautious at the height. My mother always says, \"compare yourself only to who you were yesterday,\" meaning if I am not improving every day, I am falling behind. \n\nAt Syosset High School: \nDuring my time at Syosset High School, I could not become an officer of a club because of grade requirements. However, I did help out in the Investment club by raising funds after school, selling pizza. In the Entrepreneurship club, by getting four of my friends to join the club where we would meet with successful business people. \n\nAt Independence High School:\nWhile my time in-person at the school has been short, I have already reached out and met with the board of the National Honors Society board and am helping them create and logo for this year's merchandise using my graphic design knowledge. I enjoy this type of work as it helps me gain experience while also helping the community.\n\nElaborate on what you would like the college admission committee to know about you regarding personal qualities, unusual talents, academic strengths, community activities, etc\n\nMy university should know my story, the building blocks to who I am today. Having moved five homes, I have gotten a diverse look into the lives of others. Due to this, I can easily empathize with the challenges people face. In addition, I problem solve quicker than most after being exposed to multiple ways of doing a task. While a nomadic life may look stressful to most, it plays an advantage in developing my social consciousness. \n\nThe exposure has allowed me to contribute to community efforts, such as creating a fundraiser to supply food and essentials to those suffering in the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. My friends and I arranged boxes and negotiated with retailers to provide cost-effective supplies to give out. We utilized Facebook to search for those who needed help most at the time\u2014sometimes driving to Brooklyn, an hour drive from Long Island, just to deliver a box of food to a woman who just lost her job due to the circumstances. \n\nThen a monumental shift when my family moved to Dallas, but it was easy for me; I knew what had to be done and how to adapt. I was a pro at this point. Moving multiple times has allowed me to grasp a comprehensive view of the world and prepared me to adjust to my environment in the future. \n\nSome talents are genetic or even innate. Marketing represents this quality for me. It just seems right to me. Ever since I was young, I have been able to sell anything. At six years old, I traded my pokemon cards and snacks for what I thought was the better share of the deal. Today I run an e-commerce business selling electronics and apparel nationwide. It's just in my genes; it seems native. \nWhat do you consider to be your most important activity/(ies) outside of school? You may include jobs, religious activities, hobbies, and special talents. Why are these important to you? \n\nExperience came in many fields for me, mainly in the last two years of my life. In 2016 I volunteered to do graphic design and photography for a local community my family was involved in. Their goal was to involve more youth members using digital media. \n\nThe only problem was, I had no prior experience. I used web-based programs for the flyer designs, and I would use my sister's Nikon camera to shoot pictures for the photography. Later on, I'd go on to explore the depths of how I can use digital media.2 I learned photography, video editing, and some graphic design in just a couple of weeks. I was eager to learn, and designing seemed to come easily with my interest in tech. \n\nLittle did I know this volunteering changed everything for me. It took years to grasp some design and video editing concepts, many of which I don't even know today, but most beneficial was the start. A few years later, I was hired for some baking company to make Instagram posts. I would charge $20 for each. Looking back at it, I realize my prices were extremely low for the quality of work. \n\nDuring the same time, my friend had told me about the profitable business of reselling sneakers. I tried that and started using my graphic design experience to create high-ranking eBay listings for what I was selling. I didn't think much of it for some time...\n\nThen the world was hit with the COVID-19 pandemic. I started to help my dad shift his business because his sole source of income, physical cell phone stores, had to be shut down due to the state mandate. My dad and I would build a wholesale brand in March of 2020 to make an income. I would also explore resale opportunities on the side, separately, that I would start saving up and investing in. From some birthday money I was saving up for three years, I had managed to buy shoes, toys, and other limited, high-profit items. \n\nWhen we moved to Texas, I had some capital left after liquidating my small stock in New York. I made choices based on what we learned in class, and I would buy popular children's toys and games to prepare for the holiday season when supply would be low, but demand would skyrocket. The market was low on stock due to shipping difficulties regarding the pandemic, increasing the already high holiday premiums leading to my first 1,000 orders, all while attending virtual classes from my laptop. I would write my essays early in the morning to have enough time to package shipments for the afternoon. \n\n\nWhich high school teacher/class has impacted you most, and why/how?\n\nIn 10th grade, I took a College Marketing Class; this would be my first College Level course, earning me six credits by the end of the school year. The class would serve my interests and introduce new strategies to me. \n\nThrough the course, I gained the opportunity to be selected for a marketing and design competition\u2014a perfect blend of my skills. We were posed with creating a logo and rebranding strategy for an old Italian restaurant looking to open itself up to a younger crowd. Using my graphic design experience and my newly found marketing strategies, I worked a month on the poster board and elements to present. I would stay after school and come early to create what I thought was my best work at the time. \n\nI ended up getting 2nd place out of the 32 contestants that day. The only weakness in my display was my presenting skills; I had focused too much on the graphics and board aesthetics that I forgot to review the delivery. I'd be super observant in class for the rest of the course to up my presentation ability. I felt so defeated that I watched hours of presenters on YouTube for the next few months. I've watched TED Talks on every topic. Today, I am a confident presenter and can establish my presence acting as a magnet to watch and absorb.\n\nIn what ways are you more prepared to live independently than you were two years ago?\n\nFor most of last year, I already felt I was living independently. My sister was home from Boston College after getting diagnosed with Leukemia. My mother was expecting my younger brother. Meanwhile, my dad would search for work, and my little sister would be in school until 3:30. With my virtual classes in session, I would be responsible for making my meals and making enough for my mom and sisters. I realized afterward that the experience helped a lot with my time management skills, even experimenting by getting up earlier to give myself a head start on the day. I downloaded the Walmart+ app, so instead of going to the grocery store when my mom wasn't feeling well, we could just order groceries digitally, saving a lot of time and energy.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish in the future? What are your post-graduate plans?\n\nHave you ever heard of the 'Zone of Genius'? Gay Hendricks wrote about the concept in his book The Big Leap. Simply put, it is the point where all your skills and your 'innate genius' meet. The zone is what is most seems most effortless for you and difficult for the majority. To bring it to its potential, we must practice our natural talent and blend it with our passions. For me, that is Graphic Design and Marketing paired with my interest in blockchain technology. Along with some friends, I have already started building a project utilizing the technology, and I have so many ideas on how to implement it into everyone's daily life. \n\nBlockchain is my future because it is ultimately humanity's future. The technology is our only hope to introduce a transparent commerce system when the people in power prefer to hide their shady dealings. It solves the problem of corruption and resolves some of the power of giant corporations. Blockchain technology can't be stopped, and nor can I.\n\nThe only thing I know for certain is that blockchain will be involved in my future; the rest is flexible. Given the adaptable nature I eluded earlier, I am willing to go where life takes me. \n\nWhat other information would be helpful for your counselor to know? Difficulties overcome, struggles, mitigating circumstances, passions... Be sure to mention if you moved to our school during HS, if you have a disability, or if anything else has impacted your GPA. \n\nMy GPA would look better if I did not engage in multiple out-of-school activities last year. I would work on my e-commerce business for a significant portion of the day, leaving less time for school work and studying. The only day I took off was the day of my AP test. Had I portioned the time out for studying instead of working, I would see the results in my favor. However, I decided on my future as I believe the experience I gained combats a few percentage points. \n\nThe same goes for my SAT, I probably should have studied when I was working, but I did not. I took my first SAT this year with no PSAT before. Decisions were made; I can't tell if they were good ones until the future.\n\nAs for my Freshman and Sophomore grades, I am pretty satisfied knowing the rigorous courses offered there. I never missed honor roll any quarter, and knowing how competitive the school was, it felt like an outstanding achievement. The classes were challenging, and I knew no one with a perfect GPA there. \n\nHowever, I learned that Frisco School District often allows retests on every exam until a student reaches 100% and uses other tactics such as 'waterfalling' to ensure no student fails. Therefore my GPA will be lower than most of the others because my former school did not allow such practices. Although this is the case, I won't let it worry me as it will push me harder to come out on top.", "Here's an article that may help:\nFive Examples of Transfer Apply Texas Essay A Statement of Purpose\nDSC\\_0201\\_1.JPG\nUT requires all prospective external transfer students to write a 500-750 word response to Apply Texas Essay A:\n\nThe statement of purpose will provide an opportunity to explain any extenuating circumstances that you feel could add value to your application. You may also want to explain unique aspects of your academic background or valued experiences you may have had that relate to your academic discipline. The statement of purpose is not meant to be a listing of accomplishments in high school or a record of your participation in school-related activities. Rather, this is your opportunity to address the admissions committee directly and to let us know more about you as an individual, in a manner that your transcripts and other application information cannot convey. \n\nAlthough the prompt is lengthy, UT-Austin reviewers are looking for you to address directly a few things, more or less in this order: \n\nYour previous academic experiences and development \n\nYour current studies \n\nYour future academic and professional goals\n\nHow a UT education can help you achieve them\n\nAny special or extenuating circumstances.\n\nI provide a series of blog posts offering tips starting here.\n\nThroughout, you should provide specific examples why you are deserving of a space on campus and in your major and what perspectives you bring to the university.\n\nBelow, I provide five different approaches to addressing this question. Each of these applicants gained admission.\n\nInterested in working together?

I felt the familiarity of being alone. Each time I change environments, it doesn\u2019t come any easier. A broad-shouldered girl in a blue shirt asked accusingly me where I needed to be. Despite intimidating me at first, she turned out to be sweet and concerned for my well-being. \n\nShe took me to my classroom and introduced me to the other girls. They all seemed so different from me. My family left the United States when I was young, and during my ten years spent in India, I switched between three very different schools.\n\nAccustomed to American schools that are relatively orderly and organized, it took time to adjust to India\u2019s disorderly schools. Just as I started feeling comfortable with the unusual teaching methods of my new school, my parents transferred me to a more \u201ccultural\u201d school. With a total of seven students in the entire school, we learned in literal shacks. \n\nMy classmates were behind in their education and far below my grade level, so the teachers focused most of their time on them. I suffered greatly when I switched back into mainstream schooling. Now, it was my classmates who raced through their work. I was thrown, unprepared, into India\u2019s rigorous education system. I struggled with constructing angles and balancing chemical equations. I had to work especially hard to make up for the time lost at my cultural school. \n\nI made it through Tenth grade with extensive additional coaching. Despite my setback, I knew that I could do better. Through my classes, I began to develop an interest with the mathematical functions that power finance and accounting. My accounting teacher became my biggest inspiration. The way she related accounting procedures to current business crises convinced me to learn more. I started keeping up with companies\u2019 corporate strategies and their effect on the economy. \n\nBefore my board exams, I completed additional work on my own and solved about 70 papers in preparation. The work ethic I acquired under her guidance is something that has stuck to me through the challenging times at community college. I continue to self-study with online courses offered on Khan Academy to further exceed expectations.\n\nAdditionally, my internship at the Pratham International School in the summer of 2016 gave me real-world experience with auditing and organizing financials. I applied my classroom and self-studying knowledge to help with vendor payment methods and profitable tuition pricing. \n\nI also pursued an internship in the accounting department of The Home Depot. For the first time, I saw theoretical concepts come to life as I helped facilitate vendor payment methods and profitable product pricing. The chance to interact with higher level financial managers gave me exposure to strategic decision making and contingency planning. \n\nI look forward to pursuing another internship and taking advantage of the connections provided by the McCombs School of Business. I hope the university will help connect me with fruitful opportunities to develop my business competencies. By participating in the Texas Stock Team and The University Finance Association, I can explore different interests and develop my network. I don\u2019t have these opportunities at Houston Community College, and I don\u2019t think any Texas university offers the unparalleled opportunities of UT. Doing research under award winning professors like Laura Starks and Robert Parrino will give me a head start in the industry. \n\nLike The University of Texas, I also want to transform myself and change the world. The past few months at the Houston community college have helped me realize that I need an environment with a limitless ceiling for growth. Since I have experienced many different educational environments, I have a good idea for what I seek while avoiding opportunities that may not be in my best interest. I bring a different perspective that will contribute to classroom discussions and be a valued addition to the McCombs community.\n\nCommentary\nI clearly remember this student\u2019s dramatic admissions decision. UT actually released almost all of their rejections and acceptances by early June, yet this applicant didn\u2019t hear back until a week later. \n\nWe both assumed that wasn\u2019t good news, but we were pleasantly surprised that they received a last minute acceptance into the McCombs School of Business. I have no doubt that their Essay A Statement of Purpose and resume tipped the scales in their favor despite their below average GPA.\n\nThey cover a lot of territory discussing being raised in two different countries and attending three different schools with radically different environments before transitioning back to Texas and attending HCC. They touch on independent studies and a relevant internship that informs their prospective major and career goals.\n\nThey also do a nice job of describing how their current college has a low ceiling and will not allow them to achieve their long-term goals. They\u2019ve done their homework by supplying a few informative \u201cWhy UT\u201d statements concerning student organizations and professors to help reviewers imagine how this student might contribute to the Forty Acres.\n\nThroughout, they argue convincingly that they know where they want to go, how they bring diverse perspectives to campus, and why UT is their best fit university.\n\nCheck out my new book Surviving the College Admissions Madness and Youtube Channel\n\nFour-Year Liberal Arts Admit 4.0 GPA\nMy decision to enroll at the University of North Texas was ill\u2013informed. Initially, I believed that, far enough away from my family yet close enough to return home every few weeks, I could grow on my terms. This unfortunate decision was fostered by my perspective of academic environments and the \u201ccollege life.\u201d I believed a university education was something purely academic, never multifaceted. \n\nAs someone who has never considered myself particularly school\u2013spirited, I did not feel the need to be connected to any larger community. I viewed my transition to college simply as a stepping stone to the next chapter of my life, a means to an end and not something inherently valuable. \n\nI chose UNT by process of elimination. I wanted to attend a Texas public university, but not as close as San Marcos and Austin or even College Station or Houston. However, the more time I spent in Denton, the more I realized that there was a low ceiling for my potential to grow. I felt like a \u201cbig fish in a small pond\u201d and my development, both intellectual and social, stalled. \n\nI have always aspired to something greater, something more challenging, something different. These aspirations, unfortunately, were not able to be experienced at UNT. My courses were stagnant, easy, \u201cgo with the flow\u201d\u2013\u2013the exact opposite of what I needed. Most students around me, even those within the Honors College, did not study for major exams or complete their assignments on time. It made me restless and uneasy. \n\nAs time wore on, I concluded I was not finding the challenges I originally sought. I refused to settle into the mediocre routines around me and merely coast along with strong, yet hollow grades. The more I considered and explored my academic goals and future, the clearer it became that only the University of Texas offers the rigor and challenge that I seek. \n\nThis fall, I visited the 40 Acres and immediately noticed a striking difference. Nearly every other student I came across wore burnt orange; people walked confidently and actually socialized on campus. There seemed to be a school spirit that was conspicuously absent at UNT. The University of Texas felt like a family, a cohesive yet still fiercely individualistic unit. Even with a just a two\u2013hour visit to the 40 Acres, I could already feel its infectious energy creeping up inside me, a feeling I would not soon forget.\n\nI had not considered that a university experience could be both academically enriching and spiritually fulfilling. Instantly, I knew where I needed to call home. My fascination and excitement was furthered with the University of Texas when I researched the Anthropology Department. I was amazed at the never\u2013ending opportunities for research. For example, Dr. Courtney Handman\u2019s focus on linguistic anthropology and her examination of recently\u2013converted Protestant indigenous communities in rural Papua New Guinea related to my interests of languages, religion, and their convergence.\n\nMy passion with linguistic anthropology began when I was nine years old when my parents took me on my first international trip. We traveled throughout Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain, Sicilia, and Croatia. With each country, there was an entire new method of communication, an entirely new way of life. \n\nExposure to different cultures and languages, however, was not an entirely new concept. I live in a bilingual home. My father grew up in Madrid and learned both Spanish and English. My father wanted to share a vital part of his identity and childhood with me, and we communicate primarily in Spanish. Later, I became unsatisfied with only speaking two languages, and self\u2013studied French. \n\nBy the time I entered high school, I could converse fluently with both my French and Spanish teachers. These experiences continue to shape and inform my desire to balance the arts and sciences by studying linguistic anthropology before enrolling in medical school.\u2003\n\nCommentary\nSince they are applying to a non-STEM program with a 4.0, it isn\u2019t necessary for this applicant to discuss their grades or relevant coursework. Despite having a high chance of gaining admission based on their grades, they leave little room for doubt by submitting a thoughtful essay that describes honestly their decision to attend UNT and why that isn\u2019t working out.\n\nIt\u2019s a balanced essay that focuses equally on where they\u2019re coming from and how UT can help them explore their interests and achieve their long-term goals. Any time a transfer applicant is coming from a four-year university, its important to discuss tastefully why they don\u2019t feel their current university is a good fit. We worked for a while on striking the right tone.\n\nTo discuss why UT is a great fit and why you want to transfer often requires developing why you\u2019re currently dissatisfied. Their reviewer can no doubt relate to their story of not knowing what they want as a high school student and how attending college gives them an idea of what they don\u2019t prefer moving forward.\n\nUT has extensive study abroad and language programs, and they develop well how UT offers resources not accessible at any other public university. They demonstrate how their current studies and travels abroad inform them that although they want to change universities, they want to continue majoring in Anthropology.\n\nInterested in working together?

It took three minutes to arrive at the base of the towering skyscraper. I sighed, disappointed, and accepted this final defeat to cap a dispiriting senior year as I nervously navigated through the downtown underground labyrinth.\n\nLike many of my classmates, I spent most of my high school years working tirelessly in hopes of attending a prestigious university. With each rejection letter, I wasn\u2019t sure any university would admit me. Receiving CAP stung particularly. I questioned the point of studying so long for my SAT and ACT and taking a few AP courses that didn\u2019t particularly interest me. Reluctantly, I submitted the deposit to my safety school. \n\nI walked to my car that day feeling like I've lost before I even started. Even getting to my interview proved frustrating. I had never visited downtown Houston. Battling traffic and tricky one-ways, I found the parking garage, slid into a space without bumping my neighbors and stumbled through the building before finding the first set of elevators, \u201cSky Lobby.\u201d I boarded. A man in his forties joined followed quickly by a college-aged student. More men and women filed in until we crunched together shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nI felt out of place, and dad\u2019s suit didn\u2019t fit right - sleeves too long and shoulder pads jutting below my neck. Everyone appeared so confident. People talked over one another as they discussed seemingly important things like upcoming meetings and lunch plans. Noises blended, a hum of indistinct chatter. After three deafening minutes of chit-chat, a merciful ding signaled our arrival. The doors glided inwards.\n\nA nervous silence preceded a burst of sunlight. I stepped into the panoramic atrium offering a birds-eye view of Houston, the Sky Lobby. Despite living in Houston for my entire life, I could never have imagined the city so beautiful. I absorbed the scenes below \u2013 the bustling traffic, the diverging currents of the bayou snaking in the distance, and the impersonal skyscrapers dotting the vista, silently taunting our unrestricted zoning laws. I swear I could almost see the curvature of the Earth, two million people all in my field of view.\n\nA friendly voice interrupted my gaze. The secretary welcomed me into a grand office that may have passed for a museum. The next moments were a blank. A blurred, neurotic, sweaty blank. Slowly, I walked back to the elevator wide-eyed, almost bewildered. \n\nWhile planning my classes at university I never really hoped to attend, I heard a ding signaling the arrival of an email on my phone. \u201cProbably some more spam,\u201d I thought. The title betrayed great news, \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\n\nIn his concluding remarks at a Dillard University commencement speech, the great Denzel Washington advised, \u201cDon\u2019t aspire to make a living. Aspire to make a difference.\u201d These words now stick to me like glue. Looking back to when those elevator doors first opened, I believe it was at that moment, with the city at my fingertips, that I aspired to make a difference.\n\nBefore, I viewed education as a means to an end, a minor footnote in my transition to the professional world. After that day, I saw the bigger picture. A purposeful education produces change within and bettering the world around me. At Houston Endowment, I learned the ins and outs of the workings of a non-profit foundation. I even had the privilege of personally speaking one-on-one with non-profit executives around Houston. While my internship is generally reserved for students at the end of their college careers, I was able to gain exposure to community and business leaders that have shown me that thoughtful, long-term efforts can make the world a better place. \n\nFrom the first moment each Longhorn arrives on the 40 Acres, they receive the message that \u201cWhat starts here changes the world.\u201d What\u2019s so brilliant about this motto is that it gives the beholder freedom to interpret their place at the university, their communities, and how their education produces ripples of change throughout the world. \n\nIt seems to me that to be a Longhorn means to be a leader. To be that which \u201cchanges the world.\u201d I don\u2019t feel a similar sense of purpose and community at UH, and feel the path to being leader lies in Austin. With the experiences I gained from my descent into Houston\u2019s philanthropic heart, I intend to hone my dream to be the leader of change that UT trains all its students to be. \n\nCommentary\nI like this essay a lot because it shares a compelling story that frames where they\u2019ve come from academically and professionally, where they currently are, and how UT can help them achieve their goals. They also discussed why they enrolled at the University of Houston, their home city, rather than pursuing UT-Austin\u2019s Coordinated Admissions Program.\n\nThey have strong statements throughout that they\u2019re deserving of a space in admissions. They discuss how they will bring a unique perspective to campus and how they seem themselves as a leader on the Forty Acres. They also touch on how their academic goals and beliefs have evolved over time, transitioning from \u201cseeing education as a means to an end\u201d to one where education is a value in itself.\n\nIt\u2019s a well-written response that no doubt helped their reviewer form a mental image of the student. It solicits empathy. Everyone can relate to the nervousness of being out of their element and receiving pleasant surprising news when they were otherwise doubtful.\n\nDespite their below average GPA, there\u2019s no doubt they gained admission on the strength of this Essay A that helped connect their expanded resume and Essay E about growing up in a mixed-religions household.\n\nInterested in building your best transfer application? Complete my questionnaire for a free consultation.\n\nMoody College of Communications Admitted Transfer 3.3 GPA \nI am currently enrolled as a first-year student at Collin College in Frisco, Texas, and I want to finish my studies at the University of Texas in Austin majoring in public relations.\n\nMy decision to attend Collin stemmed from my mediocre grades in high school \u2013 I wanted a fresh start at a college close to home. Though I was accepted at a few well-ranked Texas public universities, I had higher aspirations. I felt that I could improve my grade point average while completing prerequisite courses transferable anywhere. I lived at home allowing me to save money, help my family, and continue working at my job.\n\nDue to my family\u2019s dire financial situation, I initially wanted to pursue a degree in business and finance solely to be more financially secure and allow me the opportunity to raise my own family someday. I took several business-related classes in high school and college. My goal has always been to transfer to UT and earn a degree in finance. \n\nIn preparation for transfer, I took Algebra, Pre-calculus, and Calculus 1 and 2. Math is not my strongest subject, and I found Pre-calculus and Calculus to be especially difficult. Despite joining a study group and meeting with the professor but, unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t enough. My low math grades are not for lack of effort. \n\nAt the time, I was taking care of my mother, a single parent, and coordinating her transfer to rehab for alcohol addiction. I became the head of household responsible for caring for my three younger sisters. I became a full-time student, employee, and house mom. Instead of getting discouraged by my setback in calculus, I saw it as an opportunity to grow and reconsider my future. I realized that if math isn\u2019t my strong suit, I probably won\u2019t enjoy a career in banking. I feel like many of my friends want to go to business school, but don\u2019t actually enjoy the work or have the skills required to be a successful student. I felt that my decision to pursue finance came not from my own motivations, but pressures from friends, family, and society. \n\nI considered my strengths, and now I understand that I love communicating with people and solving problems. I\u2019m the go-to person in my friend group when relationships end or problems happen at school, and I am used to handling family crises at home. I want to help solve problems on behalf of companies, and I feel that public relations is my perfect fit.\n\nI learned to communicate effectively at an early age. No matter what situation my family was going through, my sisters and other relatives considered my opinions and often put my suggestions into practice. My survival and quality of life depends on resolving conflicts for work, for my internship, and for relaying messages within a divided family. Recognizing my strength, I feel that public relations would be the perfect major for me. \n\nTo gain firsthand experience and test my decision, I took on a Public Relations/Blogger Relations internship for Conscious Couture. Through reaching out to bloggers that have PR firms, I am reassured that I made the right decision and have truly found what I love. Also, I have previous professional experience as an executive assistant for Texas Family Fitness. I was constantly phoning clients, communicating with employees, setting up meetings, proposing new ideas, and managing conflict in the workplace. \n\nAfter doing research, I learned that UT has one of the best public relations departments and employs world-renowned faculty. I especially like the internship requirement and career placement resources. My goal is to begin with a major public relations firm and, ultimately, establish my own firm. If I decide to continue my studies after my bachelor\u2019s, the LBJ School of Public Affairs seems like an appealing way to transition into government work. \n\nCommentary\nThis particular student had a 3.0 by the deadline, and since they had less than 24 hours completed, UT waited to make their decision after receiving their spring grades. They made a D in Calculus, so this essay helps put that grade into context.\n\nI appreciate that this essay is very straightforward. They get right to the point why they are at their current university, what they hope to study at UT, and how their goals evolved over time.\n\nOne pitfall of extenuating circumstances essays is they tend towards hyperbole and overexageration. This applicant provides balance and nuance to their issues at home and concrete ways that they\u2019ve developed and matured over time. They also link their special circumstances into their proposed major, Public Relations.\n\nThey also develop well how their professional experiences and internship further influence their decision to transfer. Their Essay A complements and provides context to their expanded resume. They argue convincingly that UT is the best fit for them because of its strong academics while still being close enough to home to visit on the weekends.\n\nPutting their poor calculus grade into context, articulating but not going overboard about their special circumstances, and demonstrating their fit for major undoubtedly played a major role in them gaining admission to UT.\n\nCheck out my new book Surviving the College Admissions Madness and Youtube Channel\n\nOOS Moody College of Communications Admit 3.41 GPA\nIt was early in 2016 and I needed a job. Seton Hall \u2013 my current university \u2013 costs about $14,000 per semester just for tuition. Growing up with the potential to be the first in my family to attend college, I never took college enrollment for granted. I saw the financial burden my decision placed on my parents. I came across a job listing for a Human Resources Policy Management Resource for Johnson & Johnson. After a rigorous interview process, they offered me one of three openings among hundreds of college-educated applicants. It was a long shot since I don\u2019t study business and I lack professional experience. My position was no mere internship; I began working in March as a full-time contractor. \n\nWith no awareness of the corporate world, I had to learn office politics, bureaucracy, and division of responsibilities on the fly. I updated human resources policies from Johnson & Johnson\u2019s global business holdings and received approval from the policy owner and the legal department. Next, we worked with translators from 30+ languages to convert the documents into their language of origin. Finally, I uploaded the policies onto the HR Portal for the thousands of employees to see. \n\nI functioned as the liaison between policy owners and J&J, including those in non-English speaking countries, who were operating in different time zone. Working cross-culturally can be a challenge, but I learned quickly. I stayed organized and met intense deadlines assigned to my team by the Vice President of Global HR Services. I worked thirty to forty hours each week while taking a full course load. \n\nBefore my Johnson & Johnson contract expired, the Director of Human Resources, impressed with my work, suggested that I interview for another position. I received a job offer; however, Jeffery Vanderbeek, the former Vice President of the Lehman Brothers and former Chairman and Owner of the New Jersey Devils, called me. Nearing retirement, he recently accepted the football head coach position at Somerville High School near my hometown. Jeff heard about an online radio station I started for my alma matter Immaculata High School. He offered me a job on the spot to run the communications efforts for Somerville Football. I accepted with much excitement so I could continue pursuing my communications passion.\n\nI began by building a website and managing their nascent social media channels. I started producing a weekly documentary series following their progress during the season. I hired and managed two media interns. I divided responsibilities and maintained our daily schedule to keep our workflow moving smoothly. Some might write this off as merely doing work for a High School team, but I disagree. \n\nI answered every day to a man who occupied corner offices atop Wall Street skyscrapers and oversaw operating budgets in the tens of billions of dollars. He asked same of me as with his Lehman Brothers partners. While that could understandably be stressful, working for Johnson and Johnson prepared me for adapting to pressure and navigating powerful personalities. \n\nSomerville and Mr. Vanderbeek helped me become a team player and showcase the best side of their football team. Mr. Vanderbeek served as a mentor to me and everyday pushed me to achieve more. I am eternally grateful for his lessons on leadership and how, with ambition and hard work, I can also rise to the top to my future career, broadcasting.\n\nI visited UT in October and immediately felt at home. I sat impressed through a taping for Texas Student Television in the Moody College of Communications. I had been around video production for a number of years, but never had I seen such a group of talented professionals my age working so passionately. It really brought about much excitement within me and reignited the fire I have for the profession. The RTF program at UT is a world-class education with deep industry connections. It is where I need to be.\n\nCommentary\nLike the previous example, this straightforward essay addresses all of the things that UT reviewers are looking for. They discuss the context and buyer\u2019s remorse about attending an expensive private university, but they don\u2019t dwell on it. \n\nInstead, they focus on their strengths - pursuing a highly selective and well-paying internship and relevant social media/broadcasting examples. Since they had an influential mentor who also submitted a reference letter, their Essay A develops well their argument that they are prepared to succeed at UT-Austin.\n\nThey applied as an out-of-state student from New Jersey, so they also address in their last paragraph how UT can help them achieve their goals. Providing specific observations from their visit let\u2019s the review know that they are making an informed decision to transfer.\n\nAlthough they changed their major from RTF to Journalism after arriving on campus, they secured a recent, highly prestigious internship at the CBS Morning Show in Manhattan. They are also involved with Texas Student Television, so there\u2019s no doubt UT extending this student an offer pays dividends for the university. \n\nUT-Austin utilizes the transfer process to bring leaders onto campus who can introduce different perspectives to classroom discussions and student organizations."]}
